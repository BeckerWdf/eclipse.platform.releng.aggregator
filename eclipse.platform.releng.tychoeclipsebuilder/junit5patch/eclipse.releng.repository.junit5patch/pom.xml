     Notice that all the tasks in this pom are normally done during the packaging phase, 
     but the last few we deliberately do later, during the pre-integration-test phase, 
     in order that things be done in the right order, and changes maintained. 
     See https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.3.3/maven-core/lifecycles.html
     for complete list of phases.
