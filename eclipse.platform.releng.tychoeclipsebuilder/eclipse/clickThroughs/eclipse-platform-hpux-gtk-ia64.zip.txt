In order for this version of Eclipse to run, GTK2 libraries must be installed
and available on the library path (i.e. LD_LIBRARY_PATH).

For example, export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/gtk_64bit/lib/hpux64/

To prevent errors with workspace locking, the following command line should be
used to launch Eclipse:

"eclipse -vmargs -Dosgi.locking=none"

Otherwise, eclipse may fail to create a lock file with reason: "Workspace in use or cannot be created, choose a different one."

Note you might also need to add the -d64 option to the vmargs when using an Oracle JRE. (-vmargs -d64)

There is a bug in the Oracle Java 7 64-bit JRE (b147) which may cause Eclipse
to crash (http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7070134).  
The crash can be avoided by using the -XX:-UseLoopPredicate VM argument 
(-vmargs -XX:-UseLoopPredicate).  Alternatively, you can use a different JRE.
