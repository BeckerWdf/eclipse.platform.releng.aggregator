         Eclipse Java 9 Support (BETA) for Neon I20150901-0800 - This is an implementation of an early-draft specification developed under the Java Community Process (JCP) and is made available for testing and evaluation purposes only. The code is not compatible with any specification of the JCP. - The features patches here are intended only for the Neon I20150901-0800 main release, and if used on other versions or streams, may cause bundles to be down-leveled or up-leveled.
