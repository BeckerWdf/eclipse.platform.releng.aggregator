<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse JDT 4.3 and Luna (4.4)</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 4.3 and 4.4 in ways that affect JDT
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 4.3 plug-ins to 4.4. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems compiling or running your 4.3 plug-in on 4.4.
