<h1>
Using the JDT API</h1>
<p>Given that the JDT supplies a
full featured Java IDE, why would you need to use the JDT API?</p>
<p>If you are building a plug-in
that interacts with Java programs or resources as part of its function, you may
need to do one or more of the following things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <P>Programmatically manipulate
    Java resources, such as creating projects, generating Java source code,
    performing builds, or detecting problems in code.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Programmatically launch a
    Java program from the platform</li>
  <li>
    <P>Provide a new type of VM
    launcher to support a new family of Java runtimes</li>
  <li>
    <P>Add new function and
    extensions to the Java IDE itself</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use JDT API in
your plug-in, you must include the JDT plug-ins as prerequisites in your plug-in.xml.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>org.eclipse.jdt.core</b> is the
plug-in that defines the core Java elements and API. You should always list this
plug-in as a prerequisite.</li>
  <li><b>org.eclipse.jdt.ui</b> is the
plug-in that defines the Java UI API. You should list this plug-in as a
prerequisite if you are using the JDT UI classes.</li>
  <li><b>org.eclipse.jdt.launching</b> is the
plug-in that defines the Java launching and runtime support. You should list this plug-in as a
prerequisite if you need to launch Java virtual machines programmatically.</li>
</ul>
