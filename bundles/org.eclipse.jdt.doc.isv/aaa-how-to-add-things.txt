ADDING NEW PLUGINS:
--------------------------

To add new plug-ins you need to make changes in several places in
this doc plug-in:

1) jdtOptions.txt
- the plug-in's source folder(s) must be included on the -sourcepath
- code of required plug-ins must be added on the -classpath (the JAR(s)for non-JARed plug-ins and <plugin>/@dot for JARed plug-ins
- the API package names must be included in the (alphabetical) package list at the end of the file

2) buildDoc.xml
 - If a plug-in contributes extension points, it should be added to the list of
   plug-ins in the <convertSchemaToHTML> task in the buildDoc.xml of the
   corresponding documentation plug-in.

3) plugin.xml
 -If your plugin has javadoc API, add a line to plugin.xml under the 
 org.eclipse.pde.core.javadoc extension to associate your plugin's javadoc with
 the reference section for this doc plugin.

ADDING NEW EXTENSION POINTS:
