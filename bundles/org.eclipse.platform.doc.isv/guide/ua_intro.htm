<h2>Welcome/Intro support</h2>

<p>Intro support is a set of extension points and workbench parts that allow
plug-ins to define specialized pages that introduce a platform product to new
users. These extension points can be used to create the &quot;Initial User
Experience&quot; of the product in the form of welcome pages. Welcome pages are
intended to guide users into discovering a product's functionality. They are
typically shown the first time a product is started. They can be anything from
a single page displaying a Macromedia Flash demo, to multiple pages that are
extensible and follow the Eclipse platform's pluggable architecture. </p>

<p>Intro support is typically configured at the product level, although
individual plug-ins can contribute intro information to known product intro
configurations.</p>

<p>From a workbench point of view, the root of the intro support is in the <b>intro
part</b>. This part is specified in an extension definition. When the workbench
initializes, it creates an intro site that reserves space for the intro page.
The intro part implementation for the site is determined using product
configuration information. Once an intro part is shown, it can move between two
modes: </p>

<ul>
 <li>in <b>full mode</b>, the intro part takes over the main workbench area.</li>
 <li>in <b>standby mode</b>, the intro part moves to the side, allowing the current
     perspective to remain visible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once an intro part is established, it must be configured with intro
information. This is done using an <b>intro config</b> which is also
contributed using an extension. Individual plug-ins can add to the basic
product intro config using their own extensions.</p>

<p>We'll look at the platform SDK intro page as an example in order to better
understand these concepts.</p>
