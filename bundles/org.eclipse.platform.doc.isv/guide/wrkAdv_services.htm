<h2>Services</h2>
<p>The workbench defines a number of services that can be retrieved from the
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/services/IServiceLocator.html">org.eclipse.ui.services.IServiceLocator</a>.
Services provide a way for components to retrieve information about the workbench
without always having to go to the global singleton: <code>PlatformUI.getWorkbench()</code>.
For example:
</p>
<pre>
		IHandlerService handlerService = (IHandlerService) getSite()
				.getService(IHandlerService.class);
</pre>
<p>
Some services provide 2 optional abilities, which are usually specified in the 
service interface javadoc:
<ul>
<li>Services that support listeners can clean up the listeners automatically
when the component's 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/services/IServiceLocator.html">org.eclipse.ui.services.IServiceLocator</a>.
(used to get the service) is disposed.</li>
<li>Services can provide more localized services depending on which component they
are requested from.</li>
</ul>
See <a href="workbench_cmd_handlers.htm" 
   class="XRef">Associating a handler programmically with a command...</a>
for an example of the activation localization provided by the 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/handlers/IHandlerService.html">org.eclipse.ui.handlers.IHandlerService</a>.
</p>
<h3>
Services Provided by the Workbench
</h3>
<p>
The services provided to by the workbench now includes some of the most
common services that an
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/IWorkbenchPart.html">org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchPart</a>.
would require.  Support for service related optional abilities are specified in the service javadoc.
The availability of the service is at and below the level specified.
