<h3>Working with resources in other file systems</h3>

<p>
Most of the API in the <tt>IResource</tt> hierarchy works the same way
regardless of what kind of file system the resources are stored in.  However,
there are some particular APIs that you need to avoid when working with
resources in other file systems, because they are only designed to work
with the local file system.
