<h3>Working with resources in other file systems</h3>

<p>
Most of the API in the <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IResource.html">IResource</a></b>
hierarchy works the same way
regardless of what kind of file system the resources are stored in.  However,
there are some particular APIs that you need to avoid when working with
resources in other file systems, because they are only designed to work
with the local file system.
</p>
<p>
In particular, the <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IResource.html">IResource</a>.getLocation</b> method is specified to return
the local file system path of the resource.  If the resource is in some other file
system, then this method is not applicable and will return <tt>null</tt>.
It is better to use the method <b>getLocationURI</b> instead,
which works regardless of what kind of file system the resource is stored in.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, the method 
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IProjectDescription.html">IProjectDescription</a> getLocation</b>
and <b>setLocation</b> methods should be avoided because they are
only effective in the local file system. The URI-based location methods should
be used instead.
</p>
<h4>Linking to other file systems</h4>
<p>
You can use linked resources to create projects that draw together resources
from multiple file systems.  Simply use the method 
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IFile.html">IFile</a>.createLink(URI, int, IProgressMonitor)</b> or
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IFolder.html">IFolder</a>.createLink(URI, int, IProgressMonitor)</b>
to create a resource in an existing project whose contents are stored in another location in
an arbitrary file system.  You can even create links below other linked resources to
create arbitrary resource trees drawing from many different file systems.
