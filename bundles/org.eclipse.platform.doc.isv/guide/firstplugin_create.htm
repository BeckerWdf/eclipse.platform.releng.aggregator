Creating the plug-in project</H2>

<P >You can use any Java IDE you wish to build Eclipse plug-ins, but we'll walk 
  through the steps for building our plug-in with the Eclipse Java IDE, since this is the typical case.&nbsp; 
  If you are not already familiar with the Eclipse workbench and the Java IDE, 
  consult the Java Development User Guide for further explanations of the steps 
  we are taking.&nbsp; For now we are focusing on the code, not the tool.&nbsp; 
  However, there are some IDE logistics for getting started.</P>
<h3>Setting up your environment</h3>
<p >If you are starting with a clean workspace, you will need to ensure that 
  your code has access to the plug-in <b>org.eclipse.ui.ide</b>. This is the plug-in that supplies
  the default platform workbench.  Import this plug-in and any plug-ins it requires into 
  your run-time workbench instance by performing the steps below. If you already 
  have these plug-ins loaded in your workspace, proceed to the section &quot;Creating 
  your plug-in project&quot;.</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the resource perspective, use <strong>File &gt; Import... &gt; External 
    Plug-ins and Fragments</strong>.</li>
  <li>Continue clicking on the <strong>Next &gt;</strong> buttons until you get 
    to the screen called <strong>Selection</strong>. This screen will contain 
    a list of all of the plug-ins in your host workbench instance.</li>
  <li>Select <b>org.eclipse.ui.ide</b> and then click the button <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click on the button <strong>Required Plug-ins</strong>.  The list on the right should fill up with all the plug-ins that org.eclipse.ide requires.</li>
  <li>Click on the <strong>Finish</strong> button. Your Navigator view should 
    contain org.eclipse.ui.ide and all of the plug-ins it requires (such as org.eclipse.ui, org.eclipse.swt, etc.).</li>
</ol>
<p>For a complete discussion of setting up host and run-time workbench instances 
  consult the PDE Guide.</p>
<h3>Creating your plug-in project</h3>
<p>You will need to create a project that contains your work.  We'll take advantage of some of the
code-generation facilities of the PDE to give us a template.  This will set up the project for writing 
Java code and generate a default plug-in manifest file (explained in a moment) and class to hold our view.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the <b>New Project...</b> wizard (<strong>File &gt; New &gt; Project...</strong>) 
    and choose <b>Plug-in Project </b>from the <b>Plug-in Development</b> category.&nbsp; 
    Use <b>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</b> 
    as the name for your project and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
  <li>On the <strong>Plug-in Project Structure</strong> page, check the box for <strong>Create a Java project</strong> (this should be the default) and click <strong>Next</strong> to
   accept the default Java project structure.</li>
  <li>On the <strong>Plug-in Content</strong> page, look at the default settings.  The wizard sets <strong>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</strong> 
    as the id of the plug-in.&nbsp; The wizard will also generate a plug-in class for your plug-in and allow you supply additional information about
    contributing to the UI.  These defaults are acceptable, so click <strong>Next</strong>.  </li>
  <li>On the <strong>Templates</strong> page, check the box for <strong>Create a plug-in using one of the templates</strong>.  Then
    select the <strong>Plug-in with a view</strong> template.  Click <strong>Next</strong>.  </li>
  <li>We want to create a minimal plug-in, so at this point we need to change the default settings to keep things as
    simple as possible.  On the <strong>Main View Settings</strong> page, change the suggested defaults as follows:
    <img border="0" src="images/firstpluginpde.jpg" alt="" >
    <ul>
    <li>Change the <strong>Java Package Name</strong> from <strong>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld.views</strong> to <strong>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</strong>
    (we don't need a separate package for our view).</li>
    <li>Change the <strong>View Class Name</strong> to <strong>HelloWorldView</strong>.</li>
    <li>Change the <strong>View Name</strong> to <strong>Hello View</strong>.</li>
    <li>Leave the default <strong>View Category Id</strong> as <strong>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</strong>.</li>
    <li>Change the <strong>View Category Name</strong> to <strong>Hello Category</strong>.</li>
    <li>Leave the default viewer type as <strong>Table viewer</strong> (we will change this in the code to make it even simpler).</li>
    <li>Uncheck the box for <strong>Add the view to the resource perspective</strong>.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to proceed to the next page.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>On the <strong>View Features</strong> page, uncheck all of the boxes so that no extra
    features are generated for the plug-in.  Click <strong>Finish</strong> to create the project and the plug-in skeleton.  </li>
  <li>When asked if you would like to switch to the Plug-in Development perspective, 
    answer <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>
  <li>Navigate to your new project and examine its contents.</li>
</ol>
<p>The skeleton project structure includes several files and a Java package.  The important files at this stage are the
<strong>plugin.xml</strong> (manifest) file and the Java source code for your plug-in.  We'll start by looking at the implementation for a view and then
examine the manifest file.</p>
