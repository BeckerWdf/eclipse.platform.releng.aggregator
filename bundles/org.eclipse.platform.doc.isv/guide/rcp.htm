<h1>Building a Rich Client Platform application</h1>
<P>
While the Eclipse platform is designed to serve as an open tools platform, it is architected so that its components could be 
used to build just about any client application.  The minimal set of plug-ins needed to build a rich client application is collectively
known as the <b>Rich Client Platform</b>.  
</P>
<p>
Applications that don't require a common resource model can be built using a subset of the platform.  These rich applications
are still based on a dynamic plug-in model, and the UI is built using the same toolkits and extension points.  The layout and
function of the workbench is under fine-grained control of the plug-in developer in this case.
