Content types</H2>
<p>
<p>
The <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/package-summary.html">org.eclipse.core.runtime.content</a></b>
package provides support for defining content-types for data streams.  Content types are used by several
content-sensitive features of Eclipse, such as automatic encoding determination, comparison editor selection, and
menu contributions.  A central content registry 
managed by an <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentTypeManager.html">IContentTypeManager</a></b>
allows plug-ins to define content types and specify a class that knows how to read and describe the content.
In order to contribute content types, a basic understanding of the content framework is necessary.
</P>
<i><blockquote>
Note:&nbsp; For this discussion, we specifically avoid the use of the word <b>file</b> when talking about content.
The runtime content engine does not assume that content is contained in a file in the file system.  However,
it does include protocol that allows content types to be associated with file-naming patterns.  In practice, these
file names represent files in the file system, but nothing in the implementation of the content system assumes
that the content is located in the file system. 
<a HREF="resInt_content.htm">File encoding and content types</a> discusses the file-oriented content types
contributed by the platform resources plug-in.</blockquote></i>
<h3>Defining and describing content</h3>
<p>
The platform defines some fundamental content types, such as plain text and XML data streams.  These content types 
are defined the same way as those contributed by other plug-ins.  We'll look at how the platform defines the text 
content type in order to better understand the content type framework.
</p>
<p>Plug-ins define content types by contributing an extension for the extension point
<b><a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_runtime_contentTypes.html">org.eclipse.core.runtime.contentTypes</b></a>.
In this extension, a plug-in specifies an id and name for the content type, and an
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentDescriber.html">IContentDescriber</a></b>
which can read an input stream and supply a description of the content.  The following snippet is the
runtime plug-in's contribution for the text content type:
</p>
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
	&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.core.runtime.contentTypes"&gt;
		&lt;content-type id="text" name="%textContentTypeName"&gt;
			priority="high"
			file-extensions="txt"&gt;
			<b>&lt;describer class="org.eclipse.core.internal.content.TextContentDescriber"/&gt;</b>	
		&lt;/content-type&gt;
		...
</pre></font> 
<p>The <b>TextContentDescriber</b> is responsible for 
reading an input stream and quickly determining whether the supplied content is a valid sample of text.  
The method <b>describe(inputStream, description)</b> is called whenever the platform is trying to determine the content
for a particular data stream.  The <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentDescriber.html">IContentDescriber</a></b>
is responsible for quickly determining whether the contents represent a valid sample for its content type and returning 
a constant that indicates whether the content matches its type.  If the content does match its type, the describer
should also fill in the supplied <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentDescription.html">IContentDescription</a></b>
with information about the data.  
</p>
<p>
The <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentDescription.html">IContentDescription</a></b>
stores content-specific attributes in key/value pairs.  These attributes are specific to the particular content type.
The platform specifies attributes for the character set and the byte order of a text file, but others can be defined.
</p>
<h3>Finding out about content types</h3>
<p>
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentTypeManager.html">IContentTypeManager</a></b>
defines the protocol for the content registry.  Clients can use this class to test a content stream or to find out about
other content types in the system.
<ul>
<li><b>findContentType...</b> methods allow clients to obtain the content type (or types) for a stream and file-name pattern.</li>
<li><b>getAllContentTypes</b> allows clients to get all of the content types defined in the platform.  </li>
<li><b>getContentType</b> allows clients to obtain a content type by its unique identifier.  </li>
<li><b>getDescriptionFor...</b> methods allow clients to obtain a content description for a given stream and file-name pattern.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Content types are represented by 
<b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/content/IContentType.html">IContentType</a></b>.
This class represents a unique content type that knows how to read a data stream and interpret content type-specific
information.  Content types are hierarchical in nature.  For example, a content type for XML data is considered a
child of the text content type.  
</p>
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
		&lt;content-type id="xml" name="%xmlContentTypeName" 	
			<b>base-type="text"</b>
			priority="high"			
			file-extensions="xml"
			default-charset="UTF-8"&gt;
			&lt;describer class="org.eclipse.core.internal.content.XMLContentDescriber"/&gt;
		&lt;/content-type&gt;
</pre></font> 
<p>
This allows new content types to leverage the attributes or behavior of more general
content types.  
</p>
<h4>Character sets</h4>
<p>
The platform text content type does not define a character set for text content.  Children of the text content type
are free to specify different default character sets when appropriate, as the XML content type does.  The default
character set for XML streams is UTF-8, which means that when an XML file does not have its encoding explicitly stated
in its contents, its encoding will be deemed as UTF-8.</p>
<h4>Content type collisions</h4>
<p>
It is conceivable that two independent plug-ins contribute a content type for the same kind of content.  In this case,
the platform will select only one content describer for the content.  The describer selected is determined using a
<b>priority</b> attribute that can be specified in the contentTypes extension.  If two plug-ins
contribute a content type for the same content with the same priority, it is indeterminate which content describer
will be selected.  Once a content describer is selected, however, all registry references to the &quot;losing&quot; content
describer will be aliased to the one that was chosen.
