<title>Using AbstractHelpScope to filter an information center</title>
</head>

<h2>Using AbstractHelpScope to filter an information center</h2>

<p>
An information center can be used to serve information for more than one product. Using the AbstractHelpScope 
class it is possible to define documentation subsets called help scopes which allow for users to see only the information which 
applies to one or more specific products. </p>

<p>
A help scope consists of an id and a class which subclasses AbstractHelpScope and is defined in the extension 
point <code>org.eclipse.ua.tests.help.scope</code>. The AbstractHelpScope class contains methods for determining 
whether a table of contents, topic or index entry should be included in the scope. Once a help scope with an id of myId
has been declared it can be applied by opening an infocenter with a url of this form: 
<pre>http://<host>:<port>/help/index.jsp?scope=myId</pre>
This will present an infocenter which shows only those topics which fall within the scope myId.
