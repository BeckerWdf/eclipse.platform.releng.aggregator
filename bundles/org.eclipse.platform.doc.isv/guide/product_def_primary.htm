<h3>Primary feature</h3>
<p>When the Eclipse platform is started, exactly one feature gets to control the
overall &quot;personality&quot; or &quot;branding&quot; of the platform,
including the splash screen, window images, about box, welcome page, and other
customizable aspects of the platform.&nbsp; This feature is called the product's
<b>primary feature</b>.</p>
<p>Let's look again at the description of the platform feature in its platform
manifest:</p>
<pre><font color="#4444CC">feature 
	id=&quot;org.eclipse.platform&quot; 
	label=&quot;%featureName&quot; 
	version=&quot;2.0.0&quot; 
	provider-name=&quot;%providerName&quot; 
	<b>primary=&quot;true&quot;</b> 
	application=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.workbench&quot;&gt;</font></pre>
<p>The platform feature has been designated as a primary feature. Although it's
possible to designate many features as primary features in the feature.xml file,
only one primary feature gets control when the platform is launched.&nbsp; The
primary feature is specified using the <b>-feature</b> command line option of
eclipse.exe.&nbsp; Typically, a product only defines branding information for
one feature and designates this feature as the primary feature.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&lt;NEED TO EXPLAIN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRIMARY FEATURE AND PRIMARY FEATURE
PLUG-IN.&nbsp; How is it specified?&nbsp; Because it has the same name?&nbsp;
How do I know which plug-in to put the splah.bmp in, etc.?&gt;</p>
