<h3>Primary feature</h3>
<p>In Eclipse 2.1, the notion of a <b>primary feature</b> was used to customize the
product-branding aspects of a product.  This mechanism is still supported in Eclipse 3.0,
but as a legacy feature.  Newly developed products should use the <a href="product_def_extpt.htm">products extension point</a>
to define a product.
</p>
<p>The remainder of this discussion describes the legacy implementation for primary features.</p>
<p>When the Eclipse platform is started, exactly one feature can control
  the overall &quot;personality&quot; or &quot;branding&quot; of the platform,
  including the splash screen, window images, about box, welcome page, and other
  customizable aspects of the platform.&nbsp; This feature is called the product's <b>primary feature</b>.</p>
<p>Let's look again at the description of the platform feature in its platform
manifest:</p>
<pre><font color="#4444CC">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;feature
      id="org.eclipse.platform"
      label="%featureName"
      version="3.0.0"
      provider-name="%providerName"
      plugin=""
      image="eclipse_update_120.jpg"
      <b>primary="true"</b>
      application="org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench"&gt;
      ...
</font></pre>
<p>The platform feature has been designated as a primary feature. Although it's
possible to designate many features as primary features in their <b>feature.xml</b> 
files, only one primary feature gets control when the platform is launched. This
is controlled in the product's <b>install.ini </b>file underneath the <b>eclipse</b>
directory.&nbsp; The <b>feature.default.id</b> property in this file designates
the primary feature for the product.&nbsp; Typically, a product only defines branding information for
one feature and designates this feature in the <b>install.ini </b>file.&nbsp;
(If there are multiple eligible primary features, the <b>-feature </b>command
line option for <b>eclipse.exe</b> overrides the choice made in <b>install.ini</b>.) </p>
