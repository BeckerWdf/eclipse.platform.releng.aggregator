Http Service and JSP support</H1>
<p>
Equinox provides support for building and running OSGi based web applications both inside RCP and application server environments. The platform SDK
comes packaged with <b>org.eclipse.equinox.http.jetty</b>, an implementation of the <a href="http://www2.osgi.org/javadoc/r4/org/osgi/service/http/HttpService.html">OSGi Http Service</a> that uses Jetty as its underlying servlet container. In an OSGi web application use
of the Http Service replaces the use of web.xml deployment file. The Http Service provides a means to register servlets and resources in a manner
more consistent with the dynamic environment in Eclipse where bundles can come and go. 
</p>
<p>
Java Server Pages play a central role in many java server environments, allowing the presentation of dynamic content. On-the-fly compilation of JSPs
is provided by <b>org.eclipse.equinox.jsp.jasper</b>'s JSPServlet.
</p>

<h2>Http Service Extension Points</h2>
<p>
In many cases it's easier to use the more declarative style of interaction as provided by the extension registry. For these purposes 
<b>org.eclipse.equinox.http.registry</b> provides extension points for 
<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_equinox_http_registry_httpcontexts.html">httpcontexts</a>, 
<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_equinox_http_registry_servlets.html">servlets</a>, and 
<a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_equinox_http_registry_resources.html">resources</a> that allow the equivalent 
registration of web resources in the Http Service.
</p>
<p>
A JSP Extension Factory class in <b>org.eclipse.equinox.jsp.jasper.registry</b> provides JSP support for use in conjunction with the 
<em>servlets</em> extension point.
