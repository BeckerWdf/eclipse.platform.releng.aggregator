<h3>
   Configuring a project
</h3><p>Typically, the first step in building a team UI is implementing a wizard
page that allows users to configure a project for your plug-in's team
support.&nbsp; The act of configuring a project is what assigns your team
project nature to a project.&nbsp; You participate in project configuration by
contributing to the <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_team_ui_configurationWizards.html">org.eclipse.team.ui.configurationWizards</a>
extension point.&nbsp; This wizard is shown when the user chooses <b>Team-&gt;Share
Project...</b>
</p>
<p>We'll look at this in the context of the CVS client implementation.&nbsp;
Here is the CVS UI markup for its configuration wizard:
</p>
<pre><font color="#4444CC">&lt;extension
      point=&quot;org.eclipse.team.ui.configurationWizards&quot;&gt;
   &lt;wizard
        name=&quot;%SharingWizard.name&quot;
        icon=&quot;icons/full/wizards/newconnect_wiz.gif&quot;
        class=&quot;org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.wizards.SharingWizard&quot;
        id=&quot;org.eclipse.team.ccvs.ui.SharingWizard&quot;&gt;
   &lt;/wizard&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</font></pre>
<p>As usual, plug-ins supply a <b>class</b> that implements the extension and a
unique <b>id</b> to identify their extension.&nbsp; The <b>name</b> and <b>icon</b>
are shown in the first page of the project configuration wizard if there are
multiple providers to choose from.
</p>
<p>Once the user has selected a provider, the next page shows the specific
configuration information for your provider.&nbsp; (If your provider is the only
team provider plug-in installed, then the wizard skips directly to your
page.)&nbsp; Your wizard must implement <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/team/ui/IConfigurationWizard.html">IConfigurationWizard</a>,
which initializes the wizard for a specified workbench and project.&nbsp; The
rest of the implementation depends on the design of your wizard.&nbsp; You must
gather up any information needed to associate the project with your team
support.&nbsp; When the wizard is completed, you must set your provider's nature
on the project to signify that it is now configured by your provider.
