<h3>The Eclipse file system API</h3>
<p>
The <tt>org.eclipse.core.filesystem</tt> plug-in provides a generic API for 
interacting with an arbitrary file system.  This API is similar to <tt>java.io.File</tt>,
with a few key differences:
<ul>
<li>Plug-ins can install providers for different types of file systems.</li>
<li>All methods integrate support for reporting progress and responding to cancelation,
making it easier to integrate into a graphical user interface.</li>
<li>There is support for some additional functionality not available in <tt>java.io.File</tt>,
such as getting and setting file permissions.</li>
<li>There are more convenience methods, such as copy, move, and recursive deletion.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In the file system API, the path for any given file is represented as a hierarchical
<tt>java.net.URI</tt>.  The URI scheme represents the kind of file system,
and the URI path component represents the location of the file within the file
system tree.
