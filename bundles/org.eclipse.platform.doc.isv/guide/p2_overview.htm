Provisioning platform (p2)</H2>
<p>Since Eclipse 3.4, the platform has had a new provisioning system dubbed p2.
For the most part, plug-in developers need not be concerned
about the details of p2. You continue to author plug-ins, features, and update sites
as before.  However, there are some steps you can take to optimize your applications
and update sites for use by p2, and there are some tools available for managing
p2 code repositories. Details on how to use these tools can be found in this section.
