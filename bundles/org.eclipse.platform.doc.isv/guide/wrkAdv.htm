Advanced workbench concepts</H1>
<p>
<a href="guide/workbench.htm">Plugging into the workbench</a> looks at the basic workbench extension points in the
context of the readme tool example.  However, there are many more extension points available for contributing to the
workbench.  
</p>
<p>The next topics cover additional workbench extensions and concepts that
you will likely encounter once you've implemented your plug-in and have begun to
refine its function.  In order to understand the next few topics, you should already be familiar
with

<ul>
  <li><a href="workbench.htm">Plugging into the Workbench</a></li>
  <li><a href="jface.htm">JFace UI framework</a></li>
  <li><a href="swt.htm">SWT</a></li>
  <li><a href="resInt.htm">Resources overview</a></li>
</ul>
Since the readme tool does not contribute to all of these extension
points, we will look at example extensions that are implemented by the platform
workbench, the platform help system, and Java tooling (JDT).</p>
