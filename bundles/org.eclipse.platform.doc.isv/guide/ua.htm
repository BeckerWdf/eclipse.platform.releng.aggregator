<h1>User Assistance</h1>

<p><b>What is user assistance?</b></p>

<p>User assistance is a set of components that together introduce the user
to the product, guide the user through tasks, and help the user find more
information about the product. There are three basic components:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#welcome">Intro (Welcome)</a></li>
<li><a href="#help">Help</a></li>
<li><a href="#cheatsheet">Cheat Sheets</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="welcome"><p><b>Intro (Welcome)</b></p></a>

<p>Intro (also referred to as Welcome) support is a set of
extension points and workbench parts that allow plug-ins to define specialized
pages that introduce a platform product to new users. These extension points
can be used to create the &quot;Initial User Experience&quot; of the product in
the form of welcome pages. Welcome pages are intended to guide users into
discovering a product's functionality. They are typically shown the first time
a product is started.</p>

<a name="help"><p><b>Help</b></p></a>

<p>The help system provides the raw building blocks to
structure and contribute documentation to the platform. It does not dictate
structure or granularity of documentation. You can choose the tools and
structure for your documentation that suits your needs.&nbsp; The help plug-in
allows you to describe your documentation structure to the platform using a
table of contents (toc) file.</p>

<p>Help also includes context help support, where a user can
summon help for a particular element in the UI (e.g. by pressing F1 on Windows).
In addition, help provides the ability to perform a single search that finds
information from any number of sources (federated information search).</p>

<a name="cheatsheet"><p><b>Cheat Sheets</b></p></a>

<p>Cheat sheets guide users through tasks. The task is broken down into steps and
presented to the user one step at a time, and the user checks off the steps as
he/she completes them. Cheat sheets come in two forms: simple (one task,
several steps), and composite (many sub-tasks, each having many steps). Which
one you use depends on the size and complexity of the task you want to guide
the user through.</p>
