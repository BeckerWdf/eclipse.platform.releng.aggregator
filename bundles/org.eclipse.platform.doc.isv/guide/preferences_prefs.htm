Preference pages</H2>
<P >
In <a href="guide/runtime_preferences.htm">Runtime preferences</a>, we looked at the runtime preferences
infrastructure from an implementation standpoint.  This viewpoint sees preferences as nodes in a tree, where each node
has a key/value pair describing a preference and its value.>/p>
<p> Now we are going to look again at preferences, from the standpoint of the client.
Rather than focusing on where preferences come from (and what scopes they are defined for), we will look at how
they are presented in the workbench UI.  We will use the readme tool example to see how it contributes a preference page to the
workbench and then look at some of the underlying support for building preference pages.</P>
