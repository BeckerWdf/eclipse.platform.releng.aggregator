Platform SDK roadmap</H2>
<P >
The Eclipse Platform SDK includes all of the function from the basic Rich Client Platform, the optional plug-ins for enhancing generic applications,
and the IDE-specific plug-ins.  It also includes plug-ins that further refine the Eclipse Platform as a high-performance Java and Plug-in
development environment.
</P>

<H3>
Java Development Tooling (JDT)</H3>
<P >
The Java development tooling (JDT) plug-ins extend the platform workbench by
providing specialized features for editing, viewing, compiling, debugging, and
running Java code.</P>
<P >The JDT is installed as a set of plug-ins that are included in the SDK.&nbsp;
The Java Development User Guide describes how to use the Java tools.&nbsp; The JDT Plug-in
Developer Guide describes the structure and API of the JDT.</P>



<H3>
Plug-in Development Environment (PDE)</H3>
<P >The Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) supplies tools that automate the
creation, manipulation, debugging, and deploying of plug-ins.&nbsp; </P>



<P >The PDE is installed as a set of plug-ins that are included in the
SDK.&nbsp; The PDE Guide describes how to use the environment.</P>
