<h3>
Activities</h3>
<P >
An <b>activity</b> is a logical grouping of function that is centered around a certain kind of task.  For
example, developing Java software is an activity commonly performed by users of the platform, and the JDT 
defines many UI contributions (views, editors, perspectives, preferences, etc.) that are only useful when performing
this activity.  Before we look at the mechanics for defining  an activity, let's look at how they are used to help
&quot;declutter&quot; the UI.
</P>
<p>
The concept of an activity is exposed to the user, although perhaps not apparent to a new user.  When an activity
is enabled in the platform, the UI contributions associated with that activity are shown.  When an activity is disabled
in the platform, its UI contributions are not shown.  Users can enable and disable activities as needed.  Certain user
operations serve as <b>trigger points</b> for enabling an activity.  For example, creating a new Java project could
trigger the enabling of the Java development activity.  In this way, users are exposed to new function as they need it, and
gradually learn about the activities that are available to them and how they affect the UI.  When a user first starts the 
platform, it is desirable for as many activities as possible to be disabled, so that the application is as simple as 
possible.  Choices made in the welcome page can help determine what activities should be enabled.
</p>
<h3>Activities vs. perspectives</h3>
<p>
We've seen (in <a href="workbench_perspectives.htm">Perspectives</a>) how perspectives are used to organize different 
view layouts and action sets into tasks.  Why do we need activities?  While perspectives and activities define similar 
kinds of tasks, the main difference is how the UI contributions for a plug-in are associated with them.  UI 
contributions are associated with perspectives in the extension definition of the contribution.  That is, a plug-in is 
in charge of determining what perspectives its views and action sets belong to.  Plug-ins are also free to define their 
own perspectives.  Even when a perspective is not active, the user can access the views and actions associated with the 
perspective through commands such as <b>Show View</b>.  
</p>
<p>Activities are a higher level of organization.  Individual UI contributions are not aware of activities and
do not refer to the activities in their extension definitions.  Rather, the activities are expected to be configured 
at a higher level such as platform integration/configuration or product install. Individual plug-ins typically do not define new activities, 
unless the plug-in is a systems-level plug-in defined by a systems integrator.  In a typical scenario, a systems 
integrator determines how function is grouped into activities and which ones are enabled by default.  Activities are
associated with UI contributions using <b>activity pattern bindings</b>, patterns that are matched
against the id of the UI contributions made by plug-ins. An example will help demonstrate these concepts.  
</p>
<h4>
Defining an activity
</h4>
<p>
Activities are defined using the 
<b><a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_activities.html">org.eclipse.ui.activities</a></b>
extension point.  Let's look at a simplified version of how the Eclipse SDK plug-in defines two activities -
one for developing Java software and one for developing plug-ins:
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
&lt;extension
	point="org.eclipse.ui.activities"&gt;
	&lt;activity
		name="Java Activity"
		description="Developing Java Software"
		id="org.eclipse.javaDevelopment"&gt;
	&lt;/activity&gt;
	
	&lt;activity
		name="Plug-in Activity"
		description="Developing Eclipse Plug-ins"
		id="org.eclipse.plugInDevelopment"&gt;
	&lt;/activity&gt;
	...
</pre></font>
Activities are assigned a name and description that can be shown to the user whenever the user is enabling and disabling
activities, or otherwise shown information about an activity.  The id of the activity is used when defining
pattern bindings or other relationships between activities.  For example, we can decide that one activity requires
another activity.
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
&lt;activityRequirementBinding
	activityId="org.eclipse.plugInDevelopment"
	requiredActivityId="org.eclipse.javaDevelopment"&gt;
&lt;/activityRequirementBinding&gt;
</pre></font>
The requirement binding states that the plug-in development activity can only be enabled when the Java development 
activity is enabled.  Related activities can also be bound into <b>categories</b>, that are shown to the user when
the user is working with activities.
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
&lt;category
	name="Development"
	description="Software Development"
	id="org.eclipse.categories.developmentCategory"&gt;
&lt;/category>

&lt;categoryActivityBinding
	activityId="org.eclipse.javaDevelopment"
	categoryId="org.eclipse.categories.developmentCategory"&gt;
&lt;/categoryActivityBinding>
      
&lt;categoryActivityBinding
	activityId="org.eclipse.plugInDevelopment"
	categoryId="org.eclipse.categories.developmentCategory"&gt;
&lt;/categoryActivityBinding&gt;
</pre></font>
The category groups the related development activities together.  This category is shown to the user when the user
manually configures activities.
</p>
<h4>Binding activities to UI contributions</h4>
<p>
Activities are associated with UI contributions using pattern matching.  The pattern matching used in
activity pattern bindings follows the rules described in the <b>java.util.regex</b> package for regular expressions.
The patterns used in the SDK are generally a fully qualified extension id - that is, the plug-in identifier followed 
by the local identifier for the extension.  The following format is used:
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
plug-in-identifier + &quot;/&quot; + local-identifier
</pre></font>
For example, the following activity pattern binding states that a UI contribution that is
prefixed by any JDT plug-in id (<tt>org.eclipse.jdt.*</tt>) is associated with the Java development activity regardless
of its local identifier (<tt>.*</tt>).
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
&lt;activityPatternBinding
	activityId="org.eclipse.javaDevelopment"
	pattern="org\.eclipse\.jdt\..*/.*"&gt;
&lt;/activityPatternBinding&gt;
</pre></font>
The next binding is more specific.  It states that the contribution named <tt>javanature</tt> defined in the
JDT core (<tt>org.eclipse.jdt.core</tt>) is associated with the Java development activity.
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
&lt;activityPatternBinding
	activityId="org.eclipse.javaDevelopment"
	pattern="org\.eclipse\.jdt\.core/javanature"&gt;
&lt;/activityPatternBinding&gt;
</pre></font>
As you can see, activity pattern bindings can be used to associate large groups of contributions with a particular activity,
or to associate very specific contributions to an activity.  The following contributions are affected by activities:
<ul>
<li>Views and editors</li>
<li>Perspectives</li>
<li>Preference and property pages</li>
<li>Menus and toolbars</li>
<li>New project wizard</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The conventions used by the workbench (plug-in id + local id) 
are merely conventions that take advantage of the id naming conventions used by the SDK plug-ins.  Plug-ins are free to 
use their own format for identifying UI contributions and for pattern-matching against those names.
</p>
<h4>Using the activities API</h4>
<p>
The workbench activity support includes an API for working with the defined activities and changing their 
enabled state.  Most plug-ins need not be concerned with this API, but it is useful when implementing function that
allows the user to work with activities, or for implementing the trigger points that enable a particular activity.
It is assumed that any plug-in that is manipulating activities through API is quite aware of the ways that activities
are configured for a particular product.  For example, the workbench itself uses the API to trigger the enablement of
activities such as Java development.  We'll look at how the workbench uses the generic activity API to implement
triggers.
</p>
<p>
The hub of all activity in the workbench is <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/activities/IWorkbenchActivitySupport.html"><b>IWorkbenchActivitySupport</b></a>.
The activity support works in tandem with an 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/activities/IActivityManager.html"><b>IActivityManager</b></a>.
Plug-ins can obtain the activity support instance from the workbench, and the activity manager from there.
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
IWorkbenchActivitySupport workbenchActivitySupport = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActivitySupport();
IActivityManager activityManager = workbenchActivitySupport.getActivityManager();
</pre></font>
The following snippet enables the Java development activity (if it is not already enabled).  It shows a
simplified version of a trigger.
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
...
//the user did something Java related.  Enable the Java activity.
Set enabledActivityIds = new HashSet(activityManager.getEnabledActivityIds());
if (enabledIds.add(&quot;org.eclipse.javaDevelopment&quot;))
	workbenchActivitySupport.setEnabledActivityIds(enabledActivityIds);
</pre></font>
</p>
<p>
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/activities/IActivityManager.html"><b>IActivityManager</b></a> also defines
protocol for getting all defined activity and category ids, and for getting the associated 
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/activities/IActivity.html"><b>IActivity</b></a> or
<a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/activities/IActivity.html"><b>ICategory</b></a> for a particular id.
These objects can be used to traverse the definition for an activity or category in API, such as getting the
pattern bindings or requirement bindings.  Listeners can be registered on the activity manager or on the activities 
and categories themselves to detect changes in the definition of a particular activity or in the activity manager
itself.  See the package <b><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/activities/package-summary.html">org.eclipse.ui.activities</a></b>
for more information.
