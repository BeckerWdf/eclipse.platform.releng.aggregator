<h2>
Guiding the user through tasks</h2>
<P>
Even when the platform UI filters out unneeded functionality, there is still a steep learning
curve faced by a new user.  The platform UI introduces several mechanisms for helping the user choose what
task needs to be done and guiding the user through the steps in that task.  These mechanisms are used by
the workbench itself to help guide Eclipse SDK users through tasks.
<ul>
<li><b>Cheat sheets</b> can help guide the user through the steps involved in a complicated task and automatically
perform some of the steps on behalf of the user.</li>
<li><b>Intro support</b> allows plug-ins to define sites that help introduce the product to the end user the first
time the platform is started.  These sites can reference help content or launch the appropriate cheat sheet
for a task.</li>
</ul>
