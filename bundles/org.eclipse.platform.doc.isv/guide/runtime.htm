Runtime overview</H1>
<p>
The only truly essential plug-in in the platform is the runtime plug-in (named
<b>org.eclipse.core.runtime</b>).  This plug-in represents the micro-kernel
of Eclipse that all other plug-ins connect to. The runtime is responsible for finding and
executing the main Eclipse application, and for computing and maintaining the
registry of installed plugins, extensions, and extension points.  The runtime plug-in
also provides an assortment of utilities, such as logging, debug trace options, 
adapters, a preference store, and a concurrency infrastructure. Of course, as 
a minimal kernel, the runtime is only interesting once an application is created
that makes use of it. Like Atlas, the runtime plug-in stoically resides at the bottom
of the plug-in heap, holding the Eclipse universe aloft on its steady shoulders.
