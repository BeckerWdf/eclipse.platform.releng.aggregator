<h2>Support for displaying markers</h2>
<p>The <a href="../reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_ide_markerSupport.html">org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerSupport</a>
extension point provides facilities for controlling how markers are displayed and organized in the UI.
This extension point handles filters and grouping in views such as the Problems view.</p>
<p><strong>Filters</strong></p>
<p>The Problems view supports multiple filters at once. When multiple filters
  are enabled, any marker that matches one or more filters will be displayed.
  New filters can be added 
  using the <tt>problemFilter</tt> element or manually by the user. Below is 
  the filters section of the Problems view showing user filters and filters added 
  via the extension point (system filters).</p>

<p><strong>Groups</strong></p>
<p>Markers can be grouped in two ways. The first way is to group marker types 
  into groups using the <code>markerTypeCategory</code> element. This is shown 
  when the user selects <b>Group By &gt; Type</b>. Below is an example showing Java 
  Problems and some using a test grouping.</p>

<p>When marker types are grouped together they will be shown in those groups in 
  the filters dialog.</p>

<p>You can also create your own grouping using the <code>markerGrouping</code> 
  element, which will show up as an extra entry in the <b>Group By</b> menu of the 
  Problems view. The IDE provides a grouping based on severity (the default). 
  The Java development tools provide a Java Type grouping.</p>
<p><code>markerGroupings</code> are resolved by checking attributes on the <a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/core/resources/IMarker.html">IMarker</a>. 
  <code>markerAttributeMappings</code> are used to specify these mappings. Below 
  is the Group By menu with the extra <code>markerGroupings</code> that have been 
  added. The Problems view is currently grouped by severity.</p>
