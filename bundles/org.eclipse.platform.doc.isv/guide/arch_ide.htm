Tooling platform</H2>

<P>
The Eclipse platform has been designed from the ground up for building integrated web and application development
tooling.  While the most basic plug-ins of the platform have been designed so that they can be used independently of
any specific tooling paradigm, (<a HREF="arch_rcp.htm">Rich Client Platform</a>), the power of Eclipse comes from the variety of plug-ins that 
build on top of this basic structure.  </P>
<P>
An important feature for the tooling (IDE) platform is the ability to manage files located in the local file system.  Many of the plug-ins
supplied in the Eclipse platform are concerned with the creation and manipulation of data stored in files in a workspace managed
by the platform.  These resources can be viewed, edited, searched, compared, and combined together using a build infrastructure.  Plug-ins that
supply resource-oriented function are considered part of the IDE tooling platform.  This includes the concrete implementation of the IDE workbench,
including the resource navigator and the ability to edit files.
</P>
<P>
Additional plug-ins, such as the help facility, supply function that is not specifically related to resource management.  These plug-ins can be added to
any configuration of plug-ins, whether the application is designed for IDE tooling or some other purpose.  
</P>
<P>
The following subsystems can be used to add additional functionality to an Eclipse application. 
</P>
<H3>
Resource management</H3>
<P >
The resource management plug-in defines a common resource model for managing the
artifacts of tool plug-ins. Plug-ins can create and modify
<b>projects</b>, <b>folders</b>, and <b>files</b>, as well as define specialized types of resources.</P>
<P >
<a HREF="resInt.htm" CLASS="XRef">Resources overview</a> provides an overview of the resource management system.</P>
<P >
Additional plug-ins enhance the functionality of the basic resource model. <a HREF="search.htm">Search support</a> provides facilities for searching the contents
of resources and supplying customized UI for displaying search results.  <a HREF="compare.htm">Compare support</a> provides facilities for 
showing two-way and three-way comparisons of resources.
</P>

<H3>
IDE UI</H3>
<P >
The IDE UI plug-in implements the platform workbench.  It defines the standard layout and configuration of the workbench and
adds specialized views, editors, and additional extension points for viewing and manipulating resources. </P>
<P >
<a HREF="workbench.htm" CLASS="XRef">Plugging into the workbench</a> introduces the workbench
UI extension points and API.</P>

<H3>Team support</H3>

<p>
The Team plug-ins allow other plug-ins to define and register implementations
for team programming, repository access, and versioning.&nbsp; The Eclipse SDK
includes a CVS plug-in that uses the team support to provide CVS client support
in the SDK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Team support is described in <a href="team.htm">Team support</a>.</p>

<H3>Debug support</H3>

<p>
The Debug plug-ins allow other plug-ins to implement language specific program
launchers and debuggers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Debug support is described in <a href="debug.htm">Program debug and launching
support</a>.</p>
<h3 >
Help System</h3>

<P >The Help plug-in implements a platform optimized help web server and
document integration facility.&nbsp; It defines extension points that plug-ins
can use to contribute help or other plug-in documentation as browsable
books.&nbsp; The documentation web server includes special facilities to allow
plug-ins to reference files by using logical, plug-in based URLs instead of file
system URLs.</P>

<P >Additional features are provided for integrating help topics in product
level documentation configurations.</P>

<P >The help facility is described in <a href="help.htm">Plugging in help</a>.</P>


<h3 >
Product model</h3>

<P >The Eclipse platform also provides a structured framework for defining a branded product that
is developed using the platform.  Plug-in developers can customize many aspects of the platform, including
splash screens, window images, and other graphics.  Products can be updated dynamically using a remote installation
server.</P>

<P >The product model is described in <a href="prouct_def.htm">What is a product</a>.</P>
