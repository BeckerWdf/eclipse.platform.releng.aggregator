Tooling platform</H2>

<P>
The Eclipse platform also supplies plug-ins that are useful for building general-purpose tools that create and manipulate data
stored in files in the file system.  These plug-ins are used by the Eclipse workbench to implement a general model for manipulating, 
viewing, and editing files.
</P>
<P>
(This section will be further updated.  The following info has been pulled out of the old SDK roadmap.)
</P>


<H3>
Resource management</H3>
<P >
The resource management plug-in defines a common resource model for managing the
artifacts of tool plug-ins. Plug-ins can create and modify
<b>projects</b>, <b>folders</b>, and <b>files</b>, as well as define specialized types of resources.</P>
<P >
<a HREF="resInt.htm" CLASS="XRef">Resources overview</a> provides an overview of the resource management system.</P>


<H3>
IDE UI</H3>
<P >
The IDE UI plug-in adds specialized views, editors, and additional extension points for viewing and manipulating resources. </P>
<P >
<a HREF="workbench.htm" CLASS="XRef">Plugging into the workbench</a> introduces the workbench
UI extension points and API.</P>


<H3>Team support</H3>

<p>
The Team plug-ins allow other plug-ins to define and register implementations
for team programming, repository access, and versioning.&nbsp; The Eclipse SDK
includes a CVS plug-in that uses the team support to provide CVS client support
in the SDK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Team support is described in <a href="team.htm">Team support</a>.</p>



<H3>Debug support</H3>



<p>
The Debug plug-ins allow other plug-ins to implement language specific program
launchers and debuggers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Debug support is described in <a href="debug.htm">Program debug and launching
support</a>.</p>
