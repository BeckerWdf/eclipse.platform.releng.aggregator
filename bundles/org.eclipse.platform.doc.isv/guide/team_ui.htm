<h2>
   Building a team UI
</h2><p>
   The team UI plug-in is based on the philosophy that the team subsystem should
   provide simple hooks and slots for providers to add their UI
   implementation.&nbsp; Rather than define standard team operations, the team
   plug-in leaves the workflow up to the provider implementation.&nbsp; All it
   does in the way of defining actions and preferences is to define a
   &quot;Team&quot; slot where you can add your specific UI elements.
</p>
<p>We've seen that some of the core team extensions, such as ignored files, file
types, and project sets, influence the UI via the preferences dialog.&nbsp;
Otherwise, you must build your own UI by designing the actions that your
repository supports and in what views and editors these actions are
accessible.&nbsp; The implementation for your UI is done with the <a href="workbench_basicext.htm">standard
workbench extension points</a>.&nbsp; In addition, you can define your own
preferences which plug in to the standard framework.&nbsp; You may even need to
build your own views to present repository specific information and operations.
(The CVS client implements its own views for synchronizing with the repository
and navigating the repository.)
