<title>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 3.5 and 3.6</title>

<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 3.5 and 3.6</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 3.5 and 3.6 in ways that affect 
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 3.5 plug-ins to 3.6. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems compiling or running your 3.5 plug-in on 3.6.

<h2>1. <a name="dialogSettings">DialogSettings.save(Writer writer) can throw an IOException</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients that call DialogSettings.save(Writer writer) in code that is compiled against release 3.5</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In release 3.4 and earlier, DialogSettings.save(Writer writer) was specified
to throw an <code>IOException</code>.  In release 3.5, the method signature was changed to not throw the
exception.  In release 3.6, the method is specified to throw the exception (restoring it to the release 3.4 
and earlier specification).  Clients that do not catch the IOException when calling DialogSettings.save(Writer writer)
should update the code to catch the exception.  Note that this source incompatibility only applies to clients who
directly use <code>DialogSettings</code>, the default implementation class.  The interface type, <code>IDialogSettings</code>,
has remained consistent in throwing the IOException in the method signature, so clients using the interface type are not
affected.</p>
