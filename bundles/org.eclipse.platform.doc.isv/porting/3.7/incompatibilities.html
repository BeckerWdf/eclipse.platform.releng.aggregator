<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 3.6 and 3.7</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 3.6 and 3.7 in ways that affect 
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 3.7 plug-ins to 3.7. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 3.6 plug-in on 3.7.

<h2>1. <a name="luceneVersion">Apache Lucene version change to 2.9.1</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients that directly reference classes from Apache Lucene</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> org.eclipse.help.base has a dependency on the Lucene bundles org.apache.lucene and
 org.apache.lucene.analysis both of which are reexported. In release 3.7 the version of the Lucene bundled with the Eclipse platform
 increased from version 1.9.1 to 2.9.1 creating a potential binary incompatibility for clients that 
 consume the classes which were reexported from Lucene.  A rebuild from source is required for any bundles
 that have a dependency to org.eclipse.help.base and references the reexported Lucene classes.
