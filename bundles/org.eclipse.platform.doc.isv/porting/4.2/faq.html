<h2><a name="architecture">How does Eclipse 4.x differ from 3.x architecturally?</a></h2>
<p>
The Eclipse SDK 4.2, for the most part, contains all the plug-ins that make up Eclipse 3.7. 
That is, all of Java development tools (JDT) and Plug-in Development Environment (PDE), 
and most of the Platform, are the same bits as in 3.7. What's different is the implementation 
of the Workbench (<tt>org.eclipse.ui.workbench</tt> plugin), and the technologies this new 
implementation is based on. Before the release, the technologies (modeled user interface, 
dependency injection and service-based programming model, CSS-based styling) were 
called 'e4' but we are now referring to them as the Eclipse 4 Application Platform.  
On top of the Eclipse 4 Application Platform, the 4.x Workbench offers an implementation 
of the 3.x Workbench APIs, to provide backwards compatibility for the Eclipse IDE and its plug-ins.
