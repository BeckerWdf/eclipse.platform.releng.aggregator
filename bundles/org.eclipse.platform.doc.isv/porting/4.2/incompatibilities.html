<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 3.7 and 4.2</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 3.7 and 4.2 in ways that affect 
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 3.7 plug-ins to 4.2. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 3.7 plug-in on 4.2.

<h2>1. <a name="runtime-auth">Platform keyring implementation removed</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients that call the following methods for
storing and retrieving passwords in the platform keyring file:
<ul>
<li>Platform#addAuthorizationInfo</li>
<li>Platform#getAuthorizationInfo</li>
<li>Platform#flushAuthorizationInfo</li>
<li>Platform#addProtectionSpace</li>
<li>Platform#getProtectionSpace</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Description: These APIs were deprecated and superseded by new
API in the <tt>org.eclipse.equinox.security.storage</tt> package in Eclipse 3.4.
These APIs made use of a custom encryption algorithm that caused problems
for organizations distributing and exporting Eclipse-based products. The system was
also inherently flawed due to relying on a password supplied on the command line
that users never set. In Eclipse 4.2 this problematic implementation has been removed.
The API remains in place and will log an exception when used.
</strong> 
</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Clients that call these methods should instead
use the corresponding Equinox security APIs for storing authentication information instead.
Refer to the deprecation comment on each method for precise migration instructions.
