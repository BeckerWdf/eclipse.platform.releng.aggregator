<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 3.2 and 3.3</h1>

<p> Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 3.2 and 3.3 in ways that affect 
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 3.2 plug-ins to 3.3. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 3.2 plug-in on 3.3.</p>

<h2>1. <a name="anchorNameHere"></a>Nested Launch Configuration Working Copies</h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Launch configuration working copies support 
  nesting in 3.3. Clients that programmatically create and save launch configurations 
  may be affected by the change in behavior of the <code>ILaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy.doSave() 
  </code> method. </p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> When a working copy (B) is created from a working 
  copy (A) which was created from a launch configuration (X), the newly created 
  working copy (B) is initialized with the attributes from the first working copy 
  (A). In 3.3, whenever a working copy is saved, it is written back to the configuration 
  from which it was created. In this example working copy B will saves changes 
  back to working copy A, and A will save changes back to the original launch 
  configuration. A nested working copy has a parent working copy that can be retrieved 
  by calling <code>getParent()</code> (newly added in 3.3). In 3.2, working copies 
  were not nested and saving a working copy always resulted in the changes being 
  saved back to the original launch configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Examine calls to <code>ILaunchConfiguration.getWorkingCopy()</code> 
  and <code>ILaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy.doSave()</code> to determine if nested 
  working copies might be created. Note that saving a nested working copy will 
  not save changes back to the original launch configuration.</p>
