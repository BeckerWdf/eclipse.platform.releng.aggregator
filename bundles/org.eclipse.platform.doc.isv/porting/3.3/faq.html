<h2><a name="signing">Impact of JAR signing</a></h2>
<p>
In Eclipse 3.3, plug-ins in the Eclipse platform are signed with a cryptographic
signature supplied by the Eclipse Foundation. Signing of plug-ins can have an impact
in three areas:
  <ul>
    <li>Code that uses non-Eclipse class loaders.  Eclipse class loaders have a flag
    that controls load-time verification of signature, and it is turned off by default.  Loaders in
    the JDK such as URLClassLoader do not have this option, and will always verify
    any JAR file that contains signatures.  If this performance impact is not acceptable,
    the only solution is to avoid signing of JARs that are loaded by other class loaders.
    A common example is JARs that are intended to be run with Ant. </li>
    <li> Use of the constructor <tt>java.util.jar.JarFile(File)</tt> (i.e., without verify = false). 
    JarFile will perform verification of signatures unless explicitly told not to. This will
    have a performance impact when the JAR is signed. If you don't need signature verification,
    be sure to use the <tt>JarFile</tt> API that does not perform verification.</li>
    <li>Use of <tt>java.util.jar.Manifest</tt>.  Since the manifest file of a signed JAR can
    be quite large, anyone reading and parsing entire manifest.mf files will see a
    performance hit. The best solution in this case is to only read the manifest
    main attribute rather than parsing the entire file.</li>
  </ul>
