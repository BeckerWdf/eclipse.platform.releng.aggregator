<p>
If you are using the action-based extension points, then you may want to specify
either a <code>definitionId</code> or a non-empty <code>label</code>.  If you
don't do this, then in the "Uncategorized" category, there may be commands
called "Legacy Action With No Label".  They will appear in the keys preference
page.  A warning will be printed to the log.
</p>
<p>
In 3.2, all actions are converted into commands when parsing the registry.  As
such, actions without a definition id have a command generated for them.  This
command needs a label, which is typically drawn from the label on the action.
In the case of actions appearing in the tool bar, sometimes neither a definition
id nor a label were specified.
