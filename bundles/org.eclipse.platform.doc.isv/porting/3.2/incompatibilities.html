<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 3.1 and 3.2</h1>

<p> Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 3.1 and 3.2 in ways that affect 
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 3.1 plug-ins to 3.2. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 3.1 plug-in on 3.2.</p>
<p><em>[No items. See the coresponding section of the <a href="../3.1/incompatibilities.html">3.1 
  Migration Guide</a> for format.]</em></p>
