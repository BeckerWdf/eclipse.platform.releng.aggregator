<title>Changes required when adopting 3.2 mechanisms and APIs</title>

<h2>Changes required when adopting 3.2 mechanisms and APIs</h2>
<p>This section describes changes that are required if you are trying to change 
  your 3.1 plug-in to adopt the 3.2 mechanisms and APIs.</p>
<h3>Launch configurations</h3>
<h4>Launch configuration resource mapping</h4>
<p>Eclipse 3.2 provides new infrastructure for associating launch configurations 
  with resources. This mapping allows the platform to perform resource based filtering 
  on launch configurations and allows the platform to optionally delete launch 
  configurations when an associated project is deleted. The launch dialog has 
  been enhanced to support a set of filters to optionally hide configurations 
  associated with closed and deleted projects. As well, the launch dialog supports 
  filtering based on selected working sets in the active workbench window, which 
  can also be selected in the launch dialog.</p>
<p>It is a client responsibility to manage the resource mapping for launch configurations. 
  API has been added to <code>ILaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy</code> to set the 
  resources associated with a configuration, and API has been added to <code>ILaunchConfiguration</code> 
  to get the resources associated with a configuration.</p>
<h4>Launch configuration migration support</h4>
<p>Eclipse 3.2 provides new infrastructure for migrating launch configurations 
  to be compatible with new tooling. For example, in Eclipse 3.2, support has 
  been added to perform resource based filter on launch configurations. Launch 
  configurations need to be upgraded to provide resource mappings in to leverage 
  this new feature. Users can manually migrate launch configurations in their 
  workspace from the <strong>Run/Debug</strong> &gt; <strong>Launching</strong> 
  &gt; <strong>Launch</strong> <strong>Configurations</strong> preference page, 
  by pressing the <strong>Migrate</strong> button.</p>
<p>An new optional migration delegate attribute has been added to the <code>launchConfigurationTypes</code> 
  extension point, specifying a class that implements the new interface <code>ILaunchConfigurationMigrationDelegate</code>. 
  A migration delegate is responsible for identifying migration candidates and 
  migrating them.</p>
