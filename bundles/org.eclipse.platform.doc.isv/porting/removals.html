<title>Deprecated API removals</title>

<h1>Deprecated API removals</h1>

<p>
  Often there is no sufficiently compelling reason to ever remove deprecated API, so the 
  API may remain in place indefinitely after the release in which it was deprecated. 
  However, there are situations where continuing to maintain the deprecated API 
  creates too high a burden for both API developers and clients: the code bloat of 
  keeping old implementations, the added complexity of multiple redundant APIs, etc.
  For this reason the Eclipse project has a 
  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse/API_Central/Deprecation_Policy">policy</a> 
  to occasionally delete deprecated API after providing two years advance notice to clients. 
  This section describes API removals that occurred in this release, and upcoming 
  removals in future releases.
</p>

<h2>API removals in this release</h2>
<p>
There are no API removals planned for the Eclipse project Helios (3.6) release.

<h3>1. <a name="workspaceLock">WorkspaceLock</a></h3>
<p>
The <code>WorkspaceLock</code> API allowed a special client (usually platform UI) to
hook into the locking protocols used by the workspace implementation. This hook
was used to mitigate deadlocks due to interaction with synchronous SWT events,
and was never intended to be used by other clients. In the 3.0 release this API
was deprecated in favor of a more general API provided by the <code>org.eclipse.core.jobs</code>
bundle. Invoking this API has had no effect since the 3.0 release. The specific API
to be removed includes:
<ul>
<li>The <code>org.eclipse.core.resources.WorkspaceLock</code> class.</li>
<li>The method <code>org.eclipse.core.resources.IWorkspace#setWorkspaceLock</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>2. <a name="updateManager">Update Manager</a></h3>
<p>
The functionality provided by the <code>org.eclipse.update</code> component (known as 
<i>Update Manager</i>), was replaced in the Eclipse 3.4 (June 2008) release by Equinox p2. The bundles that
comprise this component will be removed from the Eclipse platform and RCP features
after the June 2012 release. Equinox p2 will continue to provide full compatibility
for features and update sites created for Update Manager. The bundles to be removed
are:
<ul>
<li>org.eclipse.update.configurator</li>
<li>org.eclipse.update.core</li>
<li>org.eclipse.update.scheduler</li>
<li>org.eclipse.update.ui</li>
</ul>
