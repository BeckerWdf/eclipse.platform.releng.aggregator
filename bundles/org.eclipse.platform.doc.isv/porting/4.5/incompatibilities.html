<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 4.4 and 4.5</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 4.4 and 4.5 in ways that affect
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide
  instructions for migrating 4.4 plug-ins to 4.5. Note that you only need to look
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 4.4 plug-in on 4.5.

<h2>1. <a name="locale">Eclipse context key Translation.LOCALE provides the Locale type</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients that are getting the Locale injected.
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
The <code>Translation.LOCALE</code> key allows clients to get the current Locale injected. The
type has changed from String to Locale.
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Clients that directly use API listed above should remove any references to it.
</p>

<h2>2. <a name="xinternal">Package org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.addons.splitteraddon marked as non-API</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients accessing the package.
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>
The packages of <code>org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.addons</code> should all be internal API as the platform team
want to have the freedom to adjust them. Unfortunately it was forgotten to mark <code>org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.addons.splitteraddon</code> as
internal in 4.4.

<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Clients that directly use API listed above should remove any references to it.
