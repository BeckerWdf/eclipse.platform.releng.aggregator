<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 4.2 and 4.3</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 4.2 and 4.3 in ways that affect 
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 4.2 plug-ins to 4.3. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 4.2 plug-in on 4.3.

<h2>1. <a name="lucene">New incompatible Lucene version</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients that directly reference Lucene
API included in the platform.
</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The Eclipse platform help system has migrated from 
Lucene 2.9.1 to Lucene 3.5. This change brings improved performance and many bug fixes in help search. 
However, Lucene itself has changed in incompatible ways between their 2.9 and 3.5 releases.
See the <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs//versions/3_0_3/changes/Changes.html#3.0.0">
Lucene Change Log</a> for complete details.
</p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Clients that directly use Lucene APIs
should refer to the Lucene change log for details on what has changed.
