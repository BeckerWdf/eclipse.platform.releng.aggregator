<h2>Changes required when adopting 3.1 mechanisms and APIs</h2><p>This section describes changes that are required if you are trying to change
 your 3.0 plug-in to adopt the 3.1 mechanisms and APIs.</p>
  
<h3>Platform undo/redo support</h3>
<p>
Eclipse 3.1 provides a new infrastructure for defining <b>undoable operations</b> and a shared
<b>operation history</b> that keeps track of operations that have been executed, undone, and
redone.  It is hoped that the various undo frameworks provided by add-on plug-ins will
be migrated over time to the platform operation support, so that clients of these frameworks 
can integrate more deeply with the platform and make their undoable operations available
for undo in other plug-in views and editors.  See the 
<a href="../../guide/wrkAdv_undo.htm">Undoable operations</a> documentation for basic
information about adding undo support to a plug-in.  Plug-ins that already define undo support
or use another framework can be migrated to the SDK undo support in a staged fashion, as
described below.</p>
<h4>Migrating plug-in specific operation (command) classes to IUndoableOperation</h4>
<p>Plug-ins that already define classes describing their undoable operations should add
an implementation for the interface <b>IUndoableOperation</b> to their operation/command
classes.  Plug-ins may still use older frameworks for managing the history (command stack)
if necessary, but providing an interface for <b>IUndoableOperation</b> allows a plug-in's
clients to use the same operations in the platform operations history, and to mix and match
undoable operations from different plug-ins.  This strategy is similar to that used by
the SDK text editors to migrate to the new operations framework.  If a direct mapping of
the interface is not possible, wrappers can be used to map <b>IUndoableOperation</b>
protocol to legacy undo objects.  This strategy is used by the Platform/JDT
refactoring support.  Migration of the operation/command classes to <b>IUndoableOperation</b>
is an important step because it allows the undoable operations from different frameworks
to be utilized by other plug-ins without either plug-in having to migrate completely.</p>
<h4>Migrating command stacks with IOperationHistory</h4>
<p>Once undoable operations or commands are expressed in terms of <b>IUndoableOperation</b>, plug-ins 
that define an undo history (command stack) for keeping track of the undoable and redoable 
operations can migrate to the platform operations history by defining an <b>IUndoContext</b>
that represents their undo history.  Undo histories that were previously managed locally 
by a workbench part can be merged into the common operation history by defining a unique 
undo context for each part, adding the appropriate undo context to each operation, and
then adding the operation to the platform operation history.  Undo histories with more 
global scope can be implemented by defining a unique undo context representing that undo scope,
assigning that context to each operation, and then adding the operation to the platform
operation history.  See the 
<a href="../../guide/wrkAdv_undo.htm">Undoable operations</a> documentation for examples of
creating undo contexts, assigning them, and adding operations to the platform operation history.
</p>
<h4>Defining undoable operations global to the workbench</h4>
<p>Plug-ins that wish their operations to be undoable from workbench views such as the 
Navigator or Package Explorer should assign the workbench undo context to their operations.
See the <a href="../../guide/wrkAdv_undo.htm">Undoable operations</a> documentation for more information
about this undo context and how it can be retrieved by both workbench and headless plug-ins.
</p>
<h3>Platform undo/redo action handlers</h3>
<p>
Plug-ins that do not define an undo infrastructure or undoable operations, but wish to 
provide access to the platform's undo history, should consider retargeting the global 
undo and redo action handlers with the new common undo and redo action handlers.  The action
handlers should be assigned an undo context specifying which undo and redo history
is to be shown.  Plug-ins can use their locally defined undo contexts for showing "part-local"
undo and redo history.  The workbench undo context can be used for showing workbench-wide
undo and redo history.  Again, the 
<a href="../../guide/wrkAdv_undo.htm">Undoable operations</a> documentation 
has a complete example.</p>
<h4>Migrating text operation actions to the common action handlers</h4>
<p>Migrating text editor undo and redo actions is a bit different than simple retargeting
of the global undo/redo action handlers.  The <b>AbstractTextEditor</b> framework defines 
common text actions using a parameterized <b>TextOperationAction</b>.  These actions are stored
locally in the framework and used to dispatch various commands to an editor's text operation
target.  For text undo to work properly, the text editor framework relies on the presence 
of text operation actions with the proper id's (<tt>ITextEditorActionConstants.REDO</tt>
and <tt>ITextEditorActionConstants.UNDO</tt>). 
</p>
<p><b>AbstractTextEditor</b> has been migrated so that it creates the common action handlers, while
still assigning them to the TextOperationAction table with their legacy id's.  In this way, the
new undo and redo action handlers can be retrieved using the legacy techniques.  Text editors in the
<b>AbstractTextEditor</b> framework will inherit this behavior.  However, editors that do not
inherit this behavior from <b>AbstractTextEditor</b> should consider migrating their
actions to use the new handlers.  Editors that do not use the new action handlers
will still have working local undo support, since the JFace Text undo manager API used
by the legacy actions is still supported.  However, the undo and redo action labels will 
not be consistent with the new SDK actions, which show the name of the available undo or redo 
operation.  See <b><tt>AbstractTextEditor.createUndoRedoActions()</tt></b> for a detailed
example of creating the actions and registering them with the proper text operation action id.</p>
