<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 3.4 and 3.5</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 3.4 and 3.5 in ways that affect 
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 3.4 plug-ins to 3.5. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems running your 3.4 plug-in on 3.5.

<h2>1. <a name="launchConfigurationLocation">ILaunchConfiguration.getLocation() can return null</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients that call ILaunchConfiguration.getLocation()</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In release 3.4 and earlier, ILaunchConfiguration.getLocation() was not specified 
to return <code>null</code>. Since 3.5, launch configuration infrastructure has been enhanced to support storage
on external file systems (EFS). The #getLocation() method returns a location in the local file system - however, since 
an external file system may not map to a local location, <code>null</code> can now be returned. </p>
<p><strong>Action required:</strong> Clients that call ILaunchConfiguration.getLocation() should update
code to handle a <code>null</code> result. The #getLocation() method has been deprecated since the return
value is no longer reliable.</p>
