<h2>What's New in 3.3</h2>

<p>Here are descriptions of some of the changes of interest to plug-in developers
made to the Eclipse <a href="#Platform">Platform</a> and
<a href="#SWT">SWT</a> for the 3.3 release of Eclipse.</p>

<p>
There are also many new features oriented towards end-users of the platform
that can be viewed in the 
<a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/whatsNew/platform_whatsnew.html">What's new</a>
section of the Workbench User Guide.
</p>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Custom splash screens</b></td>
    <td>API is now in place to provide custom splash screens using
      SWT. You can use the new <tt>org.eclipse.osgi.service.runnable.StartupMonitor</tt>
      API to update the splash screen as the platform is being started.
      <p><img src="images/splash.png" alt="Custom splash screens"></p></td>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>IDE application moved to new plug-in</b></td>
    <td>The portion of the <tt>org.eclipse.ui.ide</tt> plug-in that defines the 
    application has been moved into a new plug-in: <tt>org.eclipse.ui.ide.application</tt>.
    This allows people writing their own RCP application to use existing views or APIs
    defined by <tt>org.eclipse.ui.ide</tt> without having a dependency on the application.
  </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Advanced tooltips</b></td>
    <td><p>JFace now supports tooltips that supply a
        Composite for more complex tooltips. See <code>org.eclipse.jface.window.Tooltip.</code></p>
      <p><img src="images/tooltip.png" alt="Tool tip"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Widget-independent tree and table viewers</b></td>
    <td><p>A new abstract class <code>AbstractTableViewer</code> has been introduced,
    making it possible to create subclasses that work on table widgets other than SWT's
    <code>Table</code>. More methods on <code>AbstractTreeViewer</code> have been made
    accessible to subclasses for the same reason.</p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Per-column label providers, improved editing support</b></td>
    <td><p><code>AbstractTableViewer</code> and <code>AbstractTreeViewer</code> now inherit
    from a new base class <code>ColumnViewer</code>.  A new abstraction for columns in viewers
    has been introduced, making it possible to use a separate label provider for each column.
    After creating a viewer, create appropriate viewer column objects (<code>TableViewerColumn</code>
    or <code>TreeViewerColumn</code>) and call <code>setLabelProvider</code> on the column
    object rather than the viewer itself. The new column abstraction also makes it easier to
    set up an editable table or tree - see <code>ViewerColumn.setEditingSupport()</code>,
    and to add keyboard navigation to editable tables or trees - see
    <code>TableViewerEditor.create()</code> and <code>TreeViewerEditor.create()</code>.
    Code examples can be found on the <a
    href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/JFaceSnippets">JFace snippets</a> page. 
    </p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Custom tooltips for tree and table cells</b></td>
    <td><p>TreeViewer and TableViewer now support custom
        tooltips on a per cell basis. See <code>org.eclipse.jface.viewers.CellLabelProvider.</code></p>
      <p><code><img src="images/tabletoolip.png" alt="Tool tip on cell of table"></code></p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Data binding</b></td>
    <td><p>Data binding supports automatic synchronization between UI state and model
    state and drastically reduces the amount of listener code required to implement common
    UIs. The data binding API was made public in 3.3, and the existing single plug-in was
    split into three to separate the core framework (org.eclipse.core.databinding) from code
    that implements binding to SWT and JFace (org.eclipse.jface.databinding) and code that
    binds to JavaBeans-style models (org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans).  See the <a
    href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/JFace_Data_Binding">data binding wiki page</a>
    for more information.</p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
	<td><p align="right"><b>Status handling</b></p></td>
	<td>The new <tt>org.eclipse.ui.statushandlers</tt> package introduces
	a mechanism for reporting and handling problems in the UI. Plug-ins can report
	their problems through <tt>StatusManager</tt>, along with a hint about how
	the problem should be handled. Eclipse applications and products can configure 
	how problems reported via this API are displayed to the end user.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>OSGi R4.1</b></td>
    <td>The Equinox Framework implements all the new features defined in the 
    OSGi R4.1 specification. The most noteworthy change is the standardization of the 
    <a href="http://www2.osgi.org/Design/LazyStart" target="_blank"> lazy activation policy</a>.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>New Application Model</b></td>
    <td>The Eclipse application model now implements
      the Application Admin Service from the OSGi specification. The net result
      is a more flexible application container. For example, applications can
      now be specified to allow more than one to run at a time. The lifecycle
      of an application has also been improved to allow applications to be properly
      shut down if the framework is shut down unexpectedly.
      <p> Eclipse applications can now implement <tt>org.eclipse.equinox.app.IApplication</tt>
        to take full advantage of the new application model. See the org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications
        extension point for more details on the options that can be specified
        for application extensions.</p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Equinox launcher</b></td>
    <td>The native Eclipse launcher has been rewritten
      to use JNI calls as much as possible. The Java VM will be started in-process
      using the JNI Invocation API unless the -vm argument points directly to
      a Java launcher.
      <p> Among other advantages, this change allows for SWT widgets to be used
        in the splash screen. As well, the splash screen can appear much earlier
        if the product is set up properly.</p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Equinox HTTP service</b></td>
    <td>The Jetty-based implementation of the OSGi HTTP
      service has been added to the Platform SDK along with the bundles that
      provide JSP and extension registry support. Help is now using this service
      instead of Apache Tomcat.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Support for Launching Equinox in Application Servers</b></td>
    <td>The Equinox servlet bridge allows the launching of OSGi based web applications 
    in existing applications servers.This support provides full integration with other 
    Equinox services and existing bundles and is tested for compatibility with major 
    server implementations.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Orbit project created</b></td>
    <td>The Eclipse Orbit project was created to be a home for third party libraries being 
    consumed and bundled by Eclipse projects.  Application developers can find many 
    useful Apache and other libraries in Orbit, ready to use.  Note that Orbit can only 
    host libraries that have been IP reviewed and approved by the Eclipse Foundation.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Platform proxy settings</b></td>
    <td>The platform now has a common place for configuring HTTP/Socks proxies.
    The new <tt>org.eclipse.core.net</tt> plug-in has API for accessing, storing,
    and monitoring changes to proxy settings.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
	<td>
	<p align="right"><b>JSch SSH2 Client Support</b></p></td>
	<td>The platform provides API which allows SSH2 related
	preference settings to be forwarded to the JSch SSH2 library (<tt>com.jcraft.jsch</tt>)
	when making SSH2 connections. The new <tt>org.eclipse.jsch.core</tt>
	plug-in provides this API</td>
  </tr>
		
  <tr> 
    <td><p align="right"><b>Contribute columns to vertical ruler</b> </td>
    <td>A new extension point, <tt>org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor.rulerColumns</tt> 
      allows the contribution of columns to the vertical ruler of any text editor. 
      <p> <img src="images/photoruler.png" title="A contributed photoruler is displayed along the Java editor" alt="Screenshot showing a ruler to display photos along the Java editor"></p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Extensible hyperlink detection<br> </b></td>
    <td><p>Clients can use the<code> org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor.hyperlinkDetectors </code>extension
        point to add their own hyperlink detectors and can enable their viewers using the
        corresponding methods in the source viewer configuration along with the
        <code> org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor.hyperlinkDetectorTargets</code>
        extension point.</p>
      <p> <img alt="Screenshot showing the hyperlinking preference page" title="Hyperlinking Preference Page" src="images/hyperlinking-preference.png"></p>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Mixed mode launch APIs and more</b></td>
    <td>The debug platform's launch API now supports
      mixed mode launching. For example, an ISV could contribute a launcher to
      profile and debug an application at the same time. See enhancements to
      the <code>launchDelegates </code>and <code>launchConfgurationTypes </code>extension
      points.
      <p>ISVs can also contribute one or more tabs to existing tab groups in
        the launch dialog to extend existing launch types with new function.
        For example, a profiling tool could provide a tab to configure profile
        options for Java applications. See the new extension point <code>launchConfigurationTabs</code>.</p>
      <p>The platform also allows more than one toolset to exist for launching
        the same kind of application. For example, two profilers could exist
        for Java applications and the user would be prompted to choose which
        profiler to use.</p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Debug context API</b></td>
    <td>The debug platform has new API to access the
      active debug context. A debug context represents the active state of a
      program being debugged and drives the enabled state of debug actions (step,
      terminate, etc.), as well as source lookup, visible variables, and watch
      expression values. A set of classes and interfaces have been added to the
      new package <code>org.eclipse.debug.ui.contexts </code>allowing clients
      to listen to and drive the active debug context.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Debug command API</b></td>
    <td>Debug commands represent common operations implemented
      by debuggers - for example, step over, suspend, resume, and terminate.
      The debug platform has added API allowing debuggers to provide custom implementations
      of the operations by implementing the debug command interfaces. See the
      new package <code>org.eclipse.debug.ui.commands</code>.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Pluggable detail panes</b></td>
    <td><p>API has been added to the debug platform
        allowing custom detail panes to be contributed to the Variables view.
        Clients may use any SWT control to render custom details for their variables.
        A context menu allows users to choose between available detail panes
        for each variable. See the new extension point <code>org.eclipse.debug.ui.detailPaneFactories</code>.</p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr> 
    <td><p align="right"><b>Remote help content</b></td>
    <td>Packaging a comprehensive set of help documentation 
      with a product can often significantly increase its download size. To alleviate 
      this, Help now allows you to host your documentation remotely on an <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help32/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/ua_help_setup_infocenter.htm">infocenter</a>, 
      and will display the remote contents alongside any locally installed content 
      you may have, giving you significant savings on initial download size. 
      <p> <img src="images/remote-help.png" alt="Remote help preference page"> 
      </p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Plug in help in any format</b></td>
    <td>Teams are no longer restricted to the specific
      XML formats defined by the Help system, such as table of contents XML,
      keyword index XML, etc. A new <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-ua/documents/providers_api.html"> set
      of API</a> has been added to enable Java code to generate the content at
      runtime. This allows teams who work with other formats, such as <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/dita/" target="_blank">DITA</a>,
      to write an adapter plug-in that will perform the conversion, thus avoiding
      a build-time conversion and allowing them to ship documentation in the
      format of their choice.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Improved dynamic user assistance content</b></td>
    <td>Dynamic content is now fully supported for all
      user assistance XML documents, which means you can filter, include, extend
      or replace sections of documents for any of the user assistance document
      types. These include:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Welcome</b> pages (XML or XHTML) and contributions</li>
        <li><b>Help</b> XHTML topics, table of contents, keyword index,
          and context-sensitive help</li>
        <li><b>Cheat sheets</b>, both simple and composite</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also define your own filter criteria and use boolean operators
        to achieve greater flexibility with filtering by using <b>XML expressions</b> in
        any of the documents listed above.</p></td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Added control of help/welcome content ordering</b></td>
    <td>The help table of contents and welcome items
      will now be arranged in a more meaningful order when multiple products
      and documentation sets are installed. All available products' preferences
      will be taken into consideration, and products may now use an external
      XML file similar to welcome's to specify their preferred order and visibility
      of entries in the table of contents.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><p align="right"><b>Link to anything from context-sensitive help</b></td>
    <td>You can now add arbitrary command links in context-sensitive
      help, allowing applications to perform any operation. For example, you

	<td><p align="right"><b>Compare supports File Buffers</b></p></td>
	<td>Compare now has support for file buffers which means that a Compare 
	editor can share the underlying file buffer with other types of editors 
	(e.g. Java editor) such that changes made in one editor will be immediately 
	reflected in the other. More information on this can be found in the
