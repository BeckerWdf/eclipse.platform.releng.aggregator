<H1>Using the class loader enhancements</H1>
<EM>Last update: December 9, 2002</EM> 
<P>Eclipse 2.1 includes many performance enhancements, including some in the area 
  of classloading. In order to help out with this, mark-up has been added to the 
  plug-in manifest file and this file explains its use. 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><A href="#activation">Activation</A> 
  <LI><A href="#format">Format</A> 
  <LI><A href="#classloader.properties">Use with the Classloader Properties file</A>
  <LI><A href="#trouble">Trouble-Shooting</A> 
  <LI><A href="#known issues">Known Issues</A>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A name=activation></A>Activation</H2>
The classloader performance enhancements are automatically enabled by default. 
If the user wishes to override this behaviour and disable them, then they may 
pass the <CODE>-noPackagePrefixes</CODE> command-line argument to the Eclipse 
executable. 
<P>
<H2><A name=format></A>Format</H2>
<p>Declaration of the package prefixes in the plug-in manifest file is indicated 
  by a <code>packages</code> element for each library which is declared in the 
  file. The <code>packages</code> element has a <code>prefixes</code> attrbute 
  which lists the package prefixes for that library.</p>
<p>It is quite common for jar files to contain code which reside in multiple packages. 
  For instance, the <CODE>org.eclipse.core.runtime</CODE> plug-in contains code 
  in the following packages:<BR>
  <CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;org.eclipse.core.runtime<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime,<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;org.eclipse.core.internal.plugins<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;org.eclipse.core.runtime.model</CODE>. </p>
<P>In this case, the <code>plugin.xml</code> specifies: 
<P> 
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;runtime&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;library name=&quot;runtime.jar&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;export name=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;packages 
  prefixes=&quot;org.eclipse.core&quot;/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/library&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/runtime&gt;
</code>

<P>Notice that <CODE>org.eclipse.core</CODE> is a common prefix for all packages 
in the plug-in. The alternative is to declare all 4 prefixes in the file as a 
comma-separated list. In this case one must weigh the trade-off between the 
number of checks required against multiple entries and a prefix which may 
include false hits. Depending on the way that your code is structured, it might 
be best to list as many as 5-10 package prefixes rather than going with a more 
general prefix. For instance, if all your code across multiple plug-ins contains 
the same prefix (e.g. <CODE>com.mycompany</CODE>) then you will not be taking 
full advantage of all benefits if you list only the single prefix 
"com.mycompany" in the file. 
<P>When a plug-in contains multiple library declarations, each one should account 
  for the package prefixes from its jar. 
<P>If you choose not to include any <code>packages</code> elements in your plug-in 
  manifest your code will still work but you will not be taking advantage of the 
  class loading optimization. Note that your list of package prefixes <b>must</b> 
  be complete for all the packages in all the libraries in your plug-in. If this 
  list is not complete then your code will not work.
<H2><A name=classloader.properties>Use with the class loader properties file</A></H2>
 
<p>In Eclipse 2.0.2 and early Eclipse 2.1 Integration builds, a feature was added 
  which allowed the user to specify a class loader properties file which contained 
  the package prefixes to enable the classloader enhancements. Use of this file 
  is specified <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/docs/classloader-properties/classloader_properties.html">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>Eclipse 2.1 is fully backwards compatible with the class loader properties 
  file and, in fact, it can be used in conjunction with the package prefix declarations 
  in the plug-in manifest. This section describes the behaviour of the interaction 
  between these two mechanisms.</p>
<p><em>Default behaviour: </em>(no command-line arguments) The package prefixes 
  will be read from the <code>plugin.xml</code> file and applied to the class 
  loading strategy. The <code>classloader.properties</code> file is not accessed 
  or considered.
<p><em>Using -classloaderProperties: </em>The package prefixes are read from the 
  <code>plugin.xml</code> file and then the <code>classloader.properties</code> 
  file is read. If there is an entry in the classloader properties file for a 
  plug-in which had prefixes defined in the manifest file, the entry in the properties 
  file will over-ride and take precedence. (the results are NOT merged) If the 
  entry in the properties file does not contain a value (e.g. <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime=</code>) 
  then any prefixes declared in the manifest file will be removed and the class 
  loading strategy will default to not using the enhancements. 
<p><em>Using -noPackagePrefixes: </em>Any package prefixes declared in the plug-in 
  manifest file are ignored and the class loader properties file is also not taken 
  into consideration. The class loading strategy defaults to not using the prefix 
  enhancements. 
<p><em>Using both -classloaderProperties and -noPackagePrefixes: </em>Any package declarations 
  in the plug-in manifest file are ignored. The class loader properties file is 
  read and any declarations defined within it are taken into consideration when 
  in class loading.
<P><h2><A name=trouble>Trouble-shooting</a></h2>
<p>If you get a <CODE>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException</CODE> then that is an 
  indication that there might be a problem with your entries in the manifest or 
  properties files. Try running Eclipse with the <code>-noPackagePrefixes</code> 
  command-line argument and do NOT use the <code>-classloaderProperties</code> 
  argument. This will disable all class loading enhancements with respect to the 
  package prefixes. </p>
<p>If your code runs fine after doing this, then the files could have the correct 
  syntax, but the package prefixes in the comma-separated list might be missing 
  some entries. To verify this is the problem, comment out the appropriate lines 
  in the file. Use a number sign (#) to comment out the line of the offending 
  plug-in in the properties file or use HTML comment characters (&lt;!-- ... --&gt;) 
  to comment out the packages declaration in the offending <code>plugin.xml</code> 
  file. </p>

<H2><A name="known issues">Known issues</A></H2>
If a plug-in manifest file declares the list of package prefixes, then all fragments 
which contribute to it must also list their package prefixes. If they don't then 
it will result in a <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code> problem. This can be resolved 
either by using the <code>-noPackagePrefixes</code> command-line argument to turn 
off the classloader enhancements, or by adding the appropriate package prefix 
entries to the plug-in and all its fragments.
