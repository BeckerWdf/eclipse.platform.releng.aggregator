<h2>Update site editor</h2>
<p>The update site editor uses the same concepts seen in the other PDE editors. 
However, it is different from these editors in that it has an additional page 
that controls how plug-ins, fragments and features in other projects within the 
workspace are build and placed in the update site project's folders. </p>
<p>Update site editor opens on site.xml file that is created by the update site 
creation wizard. This file represents the site map and defines what will be made 
available to Eclipse update manager when connecting to the update site.</p>
<p>The editor has three pages that deal strictly with the file content:
(Description, Features and Archives) and a Source page that shows you raw XML code of the
site map.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/site-description.gif" alt="Feature manifest editor - Overview page" width="565" height="385"></p>
<p align="left">URL provided in the Description page will be used to by the 
update manager to provide for a hyperlink to the page where information about 
the site is located. This page also allows you to define categories that will be 
used to classify features listed in the site map. Categories can be added by 
pressing the <b>Add...</b> button. An existing category definition can be 
modified by pressing <b>Edit...</b> or by double-clicking on the category entry.</p>
<p align="left">Features page is dedicated to entries that reference feature 
archives located on the site:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/site-features.gif" alt="Feature manifest editor - Information page" width="565" height="385"></p>
<p align="left">When feature entry (reference) is added in the section on the 
left, its properties can be edited in <b>Feature Properties</b> on the right. 
Property 'URL' is relative to the location of the map file, so it normally 
starts with 'features/' segments. For an update site to be valid, each feature 
reference must point to an existing feature archive in the location defined by 
the URL property. Although it is possible to add feature entries by pressing the
<b>Add...</b> button, it is better to do so indirectly in the Build page.</p>
<p align="left">The existing categories are shown in the Categories section. To 
classify a feature entry, select it and check as many categories as appropriate. 
If no suitable category is currently shown in the list, you can add a new one by 
pressing the <b>Add...</b> button (this action as the same effect as in the 
Description page).</p>
<p align="left">Default location of the storage archives can be changed in 
Archives page (see Platform Plug-in Developer Guide for site map reference 
information):</p>
