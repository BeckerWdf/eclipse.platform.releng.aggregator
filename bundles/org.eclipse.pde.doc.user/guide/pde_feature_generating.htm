<h2>Generating a feature JAR</h2>

<p>Once versions are synchronized, we can package our feature in the format fit for publishing. This
process has three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Setting up the build configuration.&nbsp; The build configuration includes
    information about the files and
    directories that should be included in the feature for each individual plug-in
    and fragment.&nbsp; There may be some design-time files and directories that
    should not be shipped.</li>
  <li>Creating Ant build scripts.&nbsp; <b>Ant</b> is an open-source scripting engine that is capable of running
scripts written in XML format. Ant is ideal for executing tasks usually found in
automated builds.&nbsp; Ant build scripts are used to create individual JARs as well as the overall
    feature JAR.
    This step is mostly automatic if the build configuration is set up correctly.</li>
  <li>Creating the final JARs.&nbsp; The JARs are built by running the Ant scripts
    created in step 2. </li>
</ol>
