<h1>Choosing a self-hosting style</h1>
<p>Simple (standalone) and binary project self-hosting each have advantages and
disadvantages. The style to choose largely depends on the usage scenario. In
general, the following recommendations apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are developing plug-ins using a standalone installation, do not
    share your work with others using a repository, compile against a large
    product - use simple self-hosting and external plug-ins.</li>
  <li>If you are part of a team and co-develop plug-ins with other members, the
    plug-ins are in a shared repository like CVS, must have a stable class path,
    must perform product-wide searches - use binary project self-hosting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The choice of self-hosting style is not something you must do upfront. When
searching for plug-in references, PDE looks in the workspace first, then tries
enabled external plug-ins. If binary projects are present, it will use them.
Otherwise, it will use external libraries qualified with ECLIPSE_HOME variable.
When switching between styles, all you need to do is re-compute class path of
the plug-ins under development.</p>
