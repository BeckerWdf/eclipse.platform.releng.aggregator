<h1>Running a plug-in</h1>
<p>As you develop your plug-in in the workspace, the incremental Java compiler
will compile your Java source code and place the <b> *.class</b> files into the
<b>bin</b> directory of your PDE project. When you are ready to test your
plug-in, you can launch a runtime workbench instance to test your new plug-in.</p>
<p>The easiest way to launch a runtime workbench is via the link in the Testing 
section of the plug-in manifest editor's Overview page. <b>Run-&gt;Run As-&gt;Run-time Workbench</b> from the main menu bar.&nbsp; 
This will immediately create a second (run-time) workbench instance that will 
appear within seconds.</p>
<p>To gain full control over the way the run-time workbench is launched, select <b>Run 
&gt; Run...</b> from the main menu bar. This will bring up the Launch Configuration 
Dialog.</p>

<p align="left">You can create several configurations and give them unique 
names, each one having different parameters. This allows you to test your 
plug-in under different conditions by simply switching between different 
configurations. </p>
<p align="left"><b>Workspace data</b> field defines the workspace that will be 
used by the run-time workbench. The location of this runtime workspace must be 
different from the workspace of your host instance.</p>
<p align="left">The default Eclipse application is <i>
org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench</i>.&nbsp; Launching it will result in a second 
workbench instance coming up whose constituent plug-ins are the workspace 
plug-ins and the plug-ins selected on the Target Platform preference page.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">You can test your runtime workbench using the <b>JRE</b> of your 
choice and does not have to be the same one against which your plug-ins compile 
in the workspace.&nbsp; You can also specify any VM arguments that are 
appropriate for your testing.</p>
<p align="left">PDE uses the values specified on the <b>Plug-in 
Development &gt; Target Environment</b> preference page to set the default program 
arguments for the launch configuration.&nbsp; If you manually change these 
values in the configuration, changes will only affect that particular 
configuration.&nbsp; Changes made on the preference page will affect all 
configurations created thereafter.</p>
<h2>Example:&nbsp; Running the Sample</h2>
<p>Press <b>Run</b>.&nbsp; Another platform instance should open. You will see a 
top menu item called &quot;Sample Menu&quot; with a single &quot;Sample Action&quot; item. Selecting it should 
pop up a dialog containing the phrase &quot;Hello,  world&quot;.</p>
