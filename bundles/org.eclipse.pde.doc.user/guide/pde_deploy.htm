<h1>Deploying a plug-in</h1>
<p>During the design phase, plug-ins and fragments in your workspace are used
as-is so that you can quickly test and debug. Once you reach the stage where you
are satisfied with your code, you need to publish it in a form fit for delivery on
the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two ways to publish your plug-in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Packaging your plug-in(s) into a <b>feature</b>. This lets you use the
    platform Install and Update Manager to deliver your feature.&nbsp; You can make it available on a
    server and publish the URL. The platform Update Manager can be used to download and install
    your feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Build executable version of a plug-in.&nbsp;This includes building all the
    declared run-time libraries as JARs and building a ZIP file containing all
    the files required to run the plug-in. Users of your plug-in will have to
    manually unzip the file into the installation directory of their platform. </li>
</ul>
<p>To build a plug-in JAR, select the <b>plugin.xml</b> for
    your plug-in and choose &quot;<b>Create plug-in JARs...</b>&quot; from the popup
    menu.&nbsp; Ant build script will be created and a wizard will guide you through
executing the script.</p>
<p>The remaining sections describe features and how to build them.</p>
