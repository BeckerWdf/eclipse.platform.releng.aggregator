<h1>Deploying a plug-in</h1>
<p>During the design phase, plug-ins and fragments in your workspace are used
as-is so that you can quickly test and debug. Once you reach the stage where you
are satisfied with your code, you need to publish it in a form fit for delivery on
the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest way to do so is through the <b>Export Plug-ins and Fragments</b> Wizard.&nbsp; It shields you from ant scripts and does not pollute your 
workspace with resources generated during the build operations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <b>File &gt; Export... &gt; Deployable plug-ins and fragments</b>.</li>
  <li>Select the plug-ins and fragments you want to export.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>You can deploy the plug-ins in one of three formats:
  <ul>
    <li>a single ZIP file whose content can be unzipped into any Eclipse-based 
    product.</li>
    <li>a directory structure, so the destination of the export operation can be 
    the root of an Eclipse installation.</li>
    <li>individual JAR archives for an Update site.&nbsp; This option will 
    result in the creation of one JAR per plug-in, and the JARs will be placed 
    in a plugins/ subdirectory of the chosen destination.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>You also have the option to save the settings of this export operation.&nbsp; 
This way you would be able to redo this export operation without having to go 
through the wizard all over again.</p>
<p>Alternatively, plug-in JARs could be built manually.&nbsp; Refer to the
