<h3>Publishing a JAR</h3>
<p>PDE does not provide automated publishing support for components.</p>
<p>To publish a component, you need to place the <b> install.xml
</b> and the component JAR on
a platform update
server.</p>
<p>See <a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/eclipse_install.html">Platform
Installation and Update</a> for a description of the update mechanisms and
directory structures expected.</p>
<p> Let us assume that there is a server that your
team uses for serving platform components. The file system structure would look
similar to this example:</p>
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
   &lt;server_root&gt;/
      install/
         components/
            install.index
            org.eclipse.platform_1.0.1/
            org.eclipse.jdt_2.9.5/
            org.eclipse.pde_1.0.4/
</pre></font>
<p style="tab-stops:.5in">The file <b>install.index</b>
in this example would contain:</p>
<font color='#4444CC'><pre>
   org.eclipse.platform_1.0.1
   org.eclipse.jdt_2.9.5
   org.eclipse.pde_1.0.4
</pre></font>
<p>You simply take your
component manifest and the JAR and place them in a directory that has the same
name format as the JAR itself minus the <b>.jar</b> extension. You
need to
add an entry in the <b> install.index</b> file because Update Manager cannot simply
iterate through the directories when accessing the server using HTTP protocol.</p>
<p>If everything is done correctly, products built on the platform can use Update Manager
to point to your site, install your component, and restart.&nbsp; When they
restart the platform, your plug-in written in PDE should be available. </p>
<p>As you continue work on your component, you can create new versions
and periodically publish them on the update server. Just don't forget to
increment version numbers.</p>
