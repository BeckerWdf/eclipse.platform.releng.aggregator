<h1>General Plug-in Development Preferences</h1>
<p>The  Plug-in Development preference page provides global settings that control:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The presentation of plug-in and feature labels in all PDE views, editors and dialogs </li>
  <li>The Automated Management of Dependencies workflow </li>
</ul>

<h2>Presentation Label Preference </h2>
<p>By default, whenever a plug-in or a feature is presented in the UI (i.e. in the outline view, Plug-ins view, editors, etc.), the label shows the plug-in or feature ID followed by the plug-in or feature version. </p>
<p>The <strong>Presentation Label</strong> preference is a global setting that allows you to show an alternate label for plug-ins and features composed of the (translated) name of the plug-in or feature followed by the plug-in or feature version.</p>

<h2>Automated Management of Dependencies Preference </h2>
<p>With the<a href="../editors/manifest_editor/automated_management.htm"> Automated Management of Dependencies</a> workflow, it is the user's responsibility to explicitly invoke the function that analyzes the plug-in code and generates the correct dependencies for the plug-in <em>MANIFEST.MF</em> file. Neglecting to update the manifests may result in class loading errors when testing the plug-in. </p>
<p>With the <strong>Automated Management of Dependencies</strong> preference selected, PDE checks all the manifest files in your workspace and makes necessary updates to the manifests prior to launching. This option is a great convenience, but it is off by default because it presents an overhead in the time to launch. </p>

<h2>Exporting Preference </h2>
<p>Export Wizard creates a build.xml file when a plug-in is being exported. If the <strong>Exporting</strong> preference is selected, the user is prompted for confirmation before overwriting this file. This preference is used to preserve any custom changes made by the user.</p>  

<h2>Source Preference</h2>
<p>When <strong>Show source plug-ins</strong> preference is selected, the source plug-ins too are displayed on Plug-ins tab of Eclipse Application launch configuration and on plug-ins import wizard.</p>

<h2>Target Definition Preferences </h2>
<p>The <strong>Prompt before deleting a target definition file</strong> preference helps user to be sure before deleting a target definition file.</p>
<p>The <strong>Include all plug-ins from target in Java search</strong> preference is used to add all the plug-ins from target platform to the Java search scope. Once selected if any plug-in is removed from Java search then this preference is turned off after prompting the user.</p>
