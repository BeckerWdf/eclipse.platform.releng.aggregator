<p class="style1">Organizing Manifest Files</p>
<p>PDE provides an <strong>Organize Manifests</strong> wizard to help update your Manifest with up to the date information.  The wizard is available under the PDE Tools menu in the context menu of a MANIFEST.MF or plugin.xml file in a PDE project.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/pde_actions/organize_manifest.png" alt="Organize Manifest" hspace="30"></p>
<p class="style3">Export Package Options</p>
<p>The <strong>Ensure that all packages appear in the MANIFEST.MF</strong> option will add Export-Package declarations for any package in the project which is not already exported.</p>
<p>The <strong>Mark as internal all packages that match the following filter</strong> option can be used to modify the visibility of any Export-Package declarations in a project's manifest.  The <strong>Package filter</strong>field should contain a regular expression use to match package names.  Packages marked as internal will not be available for use by other bundles.  Refer to the <a href="../editors/manifest_editor/access_rules.htm">Access Rules</a> document for more information on package visibility.</p>
<p>The <strong>Remove unresolved packages</strong> option will remove any Export-Package entries which cannot be resolved.  The most common reason for an exported package not not be resolved is because it does not exist in the project.</p>
<p>The <strong>Calculate 'uses' directive for public packages</strong> option will handle the complicated computations for the uses directive for any packages which other bundles have access to.  Since the computations are complex and require code introspection, this operation may take more time than other organization operations and has been marked as a long-running operation.</p>
<p class="style3">Dependency Options</p>
<p>The <strong>Handle unresolved dependencies</strong> option allows you to clean up your manifest by removing any unresolved dependencies.  A dependency may be unresolved for a variety of reasons, including an optional plug-in not present in the current configuration.  For this reason, you may elect to handle unresolved dependencies by either <strong>removing them</strong> from the Manifest or <strong>marking them as optional</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Remove unused dependencies</strong> option can help you identify and remove any unused dependencies currently defined in the manifest.  Unused dependencies may require additional unnecessary bundles to be installed in a runtime.  This operation analyzes your project's code to check for references and may take more time than other organization operations and has been marked as a long-running operation.</p>
<p>The <strong>Add required dependencies</strong> option inspect the project's code to try to additional dependencies which are not currently included in the manifest.  This computation searches will only find new dependencies to bundles listed in the <strong>Automated Management of Dependencies</strong> section of the <a href="../editors/manifest_editor/dependencies.htm">Dependencies page</a> of the Manifest Editor.  This examination may take more time than other organization operations and has been marked as a long-running operation.</p>    
<p class="style3">Miscellaneous Options</p>
<p>The <strong>Remove unnecessary Eclipse-LazyStart headers</strong> option will remove the Eclipse-LazyStart header if a Bundle-Activator is not defined.  If a bundle has nothing to contribute when it is started, the Eclipse-LazyStart header is not necessary.</p>
<p class="style3">Internationalization Options</p>
<p>The <strong>Prefix icon paths in plug-in extensions with a $nl$ segment</strong> option will modify icon paths to allow fragments to contribute unique icons for different environments.</p>
<p>The <strong>Remove unused keys from the plug-in's properties file</strong> option will help determine and remove unused keys in the plug-in's properties file.
