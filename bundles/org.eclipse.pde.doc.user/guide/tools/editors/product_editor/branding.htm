<p class="style1">Branding</p>
<p>The <strong>Branding</strong> page gives the product its identity by customizing the splash screen, window images, <em>About</em> dialog and the welcome experience. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Splash Screen </p>
<p>The <strong>splash screen</strong> is typically located at the root of the product-defining plug-in and must be called <em><strong>splash.bmp</strong></em>. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/product_editor/branding_splash.png" alt="Splash screen" hspace="30"></p>
<p>Alternately, you may choose to place it at the root of any other plug-in in the product, but the name restriction stands. </p>
<p>If you like the integrated progress bar in the Eclipse splash screen, you can   easily do the same for your product splash screen by specifying the co-ordinates of the progress bar and message, as well as the text color.</p>
<p>The integrated progress data are properties in the <em>org.eclipse.core.runtime.products</em> extension. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Window Images </p>
<p>The <strong>Window Images</strong> section specifies the images associated with a product. If the images supplied by you do not match the size requirements, PDE flags a warning at the top of the page. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/product_editor/branding_window.png" alt="Window Images" hspace="30"> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">About Dialog </p>
<p>The <strong>About Dialog</strong> is customiable by providing a custom image and text. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/product_editor/branding_about.png" alt="About Image" hspace="30"></p>
<p>The <em>About dialog</em> text and image are also properties in the org.eclipse.core.runtime.products extension. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Welcome Page </p>
<p>It is recommended to ship a product with its own <strong>welcome page</strong> to introduce the features of the product to first-time users.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/product_editor/branding_welcome.png" alt="Intro" hspace="30"></p>
<p>Providing a <strong>welcome page</strong> (Intro) requires the binding of the product to an <em>org.eclipse.ui.intro</em> extension. </p>
<p>The Intro ID combo box is populated with existing Intro identifiers defined by plug-ins in the workspace and in the target.</p>
<p>You may also create a new Intro on the fly by pressing the New.. button. </p>
