<h1>Target Overview</h1>

<p>The <strong>Overview</strong> page allows you to view and edit the name
 and locations of your target definition. As well, the <strong>Overview</strong>
 page provides hot links to <a href="content.htm"><strong>Content</strong></a>
 and <a href="environment.htm"><strong>Environment</strong></a> information.
</p>
<p>A target definition can be used utilized directly out of the workspace or 
 contributed by a plug-in with a  
 <code>org.eclipse.pde.core.targets</code>
 extension running in the platform.
</p>



<a name="target_definition"></a>
<h2>Target Definition</h2>

<p><img src="../../../images/target_editor/definition.png" alt="Target Definition" hspace="30"></p>

<p>The <strong>Target Name</strong> identifies
 your target definition in the Target Selection combo box on the
 <a href="../../preference_pages/target_platform.htm">Target Platform</a>
 preference page.  This name will be displayed if the target is referenced
 directly from the workspace.
</p>

<p>The <strong>Target Location</strong> specifies the location to which the
 target platform location should be set.  For convenience, the editor provides
 the option to specify that <strong>The target platform is the same as the host (running)
 platform</strong>.  This option should be used if you wish to develop plug-ins
 for your current host environment.  Users can also specify an absolute
 <strong>Location</strong> other than the host.  To aid in portability of
 target definitions, the path may include substitution variables.
</p>



<a name="additional_locations"></a>
<h2>Additional Locations</h2>

<p><img src="../../../images/target_editor/locations.png" alt="Additional Locations" hspace="30"></p>

<p>Target definitions allow you to include required plug-ins from
 <strong>Additional Locations</strong> other than the main target location. 
 Plug-ins found in these locations will be included in the target platform. 
 These locations need to be absolute, but can consist of substitution variables 
 to enhance portability.
