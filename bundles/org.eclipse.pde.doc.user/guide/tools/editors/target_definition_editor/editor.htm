<h1>Target Definition Editor</h1>
<p>Developers can simplify configuring their development environment by
 utilizing a target definition specified in a <em>target</em> file. 
 This file contains vital environment information including target platform
 location, plug-in configuration, and target environment settings.
</p>

<p>The target definition is entirely managed by PDE to simplify plug-in
 development. Its format is internal and is not intended to be read by tools
 other than PDE.
</p>

<p>PDE provides a form-based multi-page editor to manage the target definition.
</p>

<p>For details on the <strong>Target Configuration Editor</strong>, refer to
 the following documents:</p>
