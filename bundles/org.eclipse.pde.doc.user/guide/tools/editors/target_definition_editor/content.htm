<p>The <strong>Content</strong> page defines the contents of the target definition.  The contents can consist of both features and plug-ins.  The plug-ins which are specified and those that compose the specified feature, will be enabled when the target is loaded.</p>
<p>The <strong>Include all plug-ins from the specified target</strong> check box has been added to conveniently add any and all plug-ins which are found in the target's locations.  This can be helpful when target platforms are frequently adding and removing plug-ins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Plug-ins</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/target_editor/content_plugins.png" alt="Plug-in contents" hspace="30"></p>

You may also use the <strong>Add Required Plug-ins</strong> button to add additional plug-ins which are required by the list of current plug-ins.  You have the option to <strong>Include optional dependencies when computing required plug-ins</strong>.
