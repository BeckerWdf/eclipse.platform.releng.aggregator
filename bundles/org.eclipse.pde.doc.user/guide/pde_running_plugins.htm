<h2>Choosing plug-ins to run</h2>
<p>It is possible to alter the list of plug-ins and fragments that PDE will pass
to the run-time workbench when running or debugging.  </p>

<p>
By default, the<b> Plug-ins </b>tab is configured to select all the workspace 
plug-ins and external plug-ins that are enabled in the Preferences. </p>
<p align="left">You also have the option to launch with any subset of those 
plug-ins. This gives you great flexibility, but with flexibility comes the
danger of ending up with an invalid configuration. Use this feature carefully
and press <b>Add Required Plug-ins</b> to ensure the subset is complete.</p>
