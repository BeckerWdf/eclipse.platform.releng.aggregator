<h2>Choosing plug-ins to run</h2>
<p>It is possible to alter the list of plug-ins and fragments that PDE will pass
to the run-time workbench when running or debugging. By default, <b>Plug-ins and
Fragments</b> tab is configured to select all the workspace plug-ins and
external plug-ins that are enabled in the Preferences. However, choosing another
radio button shows the list of plug-ins that can be individually selected or
deselected:</p>
<p> In order to support tracing without the need to edit the tracing <b>.options</b> files, PDE provides a
&quot;Runtime Tracing&quot; preference page that allows you to set the tracing flags
and name filters related to loading.</p>
<p align="left">Runtime class load tracing is treated specially since it is general
and useful for most plug-in developers. PDE also provides a generic dialog for controlling
other tracing flags.&nbsp; The Advanced Tracing preference page shows all of the plug-ins that support tracing.&nbsp;
When a plug-in is selected, its supported tracing options are shown in the property
sheet. You can change the values of these tracing options for workspace and
external plug-ins.</p>
<p align="left">If you add tracing support to the plug-in under development,
these tracing values will show up in this page.</p>

<p align="left">You can select workspace and external plug-ins individually or
as a group. This gives you great flexibility, but with flexibility comes the
danger of ending up with an invalid configuration. Use this feature carefully
and press <b>Restore Defaults</b> when you are not sure what the original
setting was.</p>
<p align="left">If you want to know exactly where all the plug-ins you are
passing to the run-time workbench are coming from, press <b>Plug-in Paths...</b>
button. A window listing the URLs of all the plug-ins will open.</p>
