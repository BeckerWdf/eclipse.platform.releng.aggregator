<h3>Build Path Computation</h3>

<p>By default, PDE updates the build path of a plug-in project every time you 
change the list of dependencies in the manifest editor. If you turn off 
that feature on the Plug-in Development-&gt;Java Build Path Control preference 
page, you will have to be responsible for updating the build path every time you 
make a change to the list of dependencies.</p>

<p>You are not required to use PDE's manifest editor to take advantage of PDE's 
build path computation feature.&nbsp; You can always use the <b>Update Classpath...</b> 
pop-up menu item available on all plugin.xml/fragment.xml files and Java plug-in 
projects to explicitly update the build path of your plug-in.&nbsp; This will 
cause a wizard to open:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/classpath-update.gif" alt="&quot;Update class path&quot; wizard" width="438" height="556"></p>
<p align="left">The checkbox list will contain all the plug-ins and fragments in 
the workspace. Select the plug-ins/fragments whose build path you wish to update 
and press 'Finish'.</p>
<p> Note that when computing the build path, PDE recreates it from scratch.
That means that you will lose any entries you have added manually to the build
path.&nbsp; The build path is updated from scratch because PDE builds it
recursively.&nbsp; Here's why:</p>
<p>If a Java class is referenced by a plug-in at run time, its libraries
will be searched first for the class, then the libraries of its required plug-ins, then the
libraries of their required plug-ins, and so on. In order to recreate a similar
lookup environment during design time, PDE updates the build path recursively.
It is possible for several different plug-ins to depend on the same library. If you delete one of
these plug-ins from your dependency list, it is not safe to remove libraries all
the way up the chain because some of the plug-ins you still have on the list may
be needing them. The only way to always maintain a valid build path is to create it
from scratch.</p>
<p>In order to provide for better sharing of projects on authoring servers, PDE
adds all external libraries to the build path relative to the run-time platform location
represented by 1 or more Java classpath variables whose suffix is <b>ECLIPSE_HOME</b>.&nbsp; This 
way, you can have your code on the server and it will work regardless of the 
location of your platform install. These variables are set and managed by PDE and you are not
supposed to modify their values.</p>

<h3>Classpath containers</h3>

<p>Since 2.1, PDE provides an alternative way of expressing and computing the 
classpath. Instead of explicitly creating the entries for the dependent 
plug-ins, it introduces a level of indirection using JDT classpath container. 
The container replaces all the dependent plug-in entries and provides for a 
stable and predictable classpath. When using classpath container, your classpath 
will contain source folder(s), required plug-ins container, and JRE container 
(uses identical mechanism to provide a proxy for the real JRE entries that are 
computed on the fly). You can share this classpath on the server without worry 
that it will cause problems on other developers' machines and/or operating 
systems.</p>

<p>In order to use classpath containers, all that is needed is to open 
Preferences&gt;Plug-in Development&gt;Java build path control and select 'Use 
classpath containers...' checkbox. You will need to update classpaths of your 
project in order to see the changes applied. Once you switch to classpath 
containers, you can use either external plug-ins or import binary plug-in 
projects, or a mix of both. Whatever you do, classpath container will keep up 
with the changes and adapt.</p>
