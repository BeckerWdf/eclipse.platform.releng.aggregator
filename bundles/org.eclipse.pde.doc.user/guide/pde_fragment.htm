<h1>Fragments</h1>
<p>A plug-in <b> fragment</b> is used to provide additional
plug-in functionality to an existing plug-in after it has been installed. Fragments are ideal for shipping features like language or
maintenance packs
that typically trail the initial products for a few months.&nbsp;Another
frequent use of fragments is to deliver OS or windowing system-specific
features. When a
fragment is
detected by the platform and its target plug-in is found, the function in
the fragment is &quot;merged&quot; with the original function in the target
plug-in.&nbsp; If you query the plug-in registry, you will see the features
defined in a fragment as if they were contributed by the original plug-in.</p>
<p>While this merging mechanism is good from a runtime point of view,
developers need to view
fragments as separate entities while working on them. Fragment development is
often done by different teams, on a different schedule, sometimes even on
different operating systems from the original plug-in.</p>
<p>PDE provides full support for fragment development. Fragments can be viewed as
&quot;limited plug-ins.&quot;&nbsp; They have all of the capability of regular
plug-ins but have no concept of life-cycle. Fragments have no top-level class
with &quot;startup&quot; and &quot;shutdown&quot; methods.</p>
<p>The PDE concept of workspace and external plug-ins turns out to work quite
nicely when developing a fragment.&nbsp; You can work on a fragment whose target is an external plug-in.
Since external plug-ins cannot be changed inside the workbench, the environment
inherently supports the fact that the fragment should be developed without
modifying its target plug-in. </p>
