<h2>Running with tracing</h2>
<p>The platform provides a mechanism for tracking the activity of your plug-in at runtime
without full debugging. It allows you to use tracing flags that will cause
tracing information to be printed on the standard output (or Console view). These flags are defined in files named
&quot;<b>.options</b>&quot; and have the following syntax:</p>
<p class="Code">&lt;plug-in Id&gt;/debug = true/false&nbsp; (master switch)<br>
&lt;plug-in Id&gt;/&lt;tracing flag&gt; = &lt;value&gt;</p>
<p>The first entry represents master switch for tracing your plug-in. If you
call the method <b>isDebugging</b> in your plug-in class, it will
return true if the value of this tracing variable is true. Other tracing flags
are defined by you and their value can be obtained by using</p>
<p class="Code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Platform.getDebugOption(optionName)&quot;;</p>
<p>Most of the platform plug-ins define tracing flags, particularly the platform
core. For a
new plug-in developer, the most interesting set of tracing flags are those
related to class loading, because they can allow tracing of plug-in loading
problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p> In order to support tracing without the need to edit the tracing <b>.options</b> files, PDE provides a
&quot;Runtime Tracing&quot; preference page that allows you to set the tracing flags
and name filters related to loading.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/runtime-tracing.jpg" width="599" height="531"></p>
<p align="left">Runtime class load tracing is treated specially since it is general
and useful for most plug-in developers. PDE also provides a generic dialog for controlling
other tracing flags.&nbsp; The Advanced Tracing preference page shows all of the plug-ins that support tracing.&nbsp;
When a plug-in is selected, its supported tracing options are shown in the property
sheet. You can change the values of these tracing options for workspace and
external plug-ins.</p>
<p align="left">If you add tracing support to the plug-in under development,
these tracing values will show up in this page.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/advanced-tracing.jpg" width="599" height="531"></p>
<p> PDE provides a variant of the &quot;Runtime Workbench&quot; launcher
called &quot;Runtime Workbench With Tracing.&quot; This launcher will create the
consolidated <b> .options</b> file based on tracing settings from the Preferences and
pass it to the run-time platform instance. All the tracing output will show up in
the Console view.</p>
<h4>Example:&nbsp; Adding tracing support to your plug-in</h4>
<p>In order to allow other developers to control your plug-in's tracing flags,
you need to make these options known.&nbsp; This is typically done by placing a <b>.options</b> file in your plug-in.&nbsp; The file lists all the supported flags as well as their default values.
PDE will immediately detect this file and include it in the list of
&quot;Workspace Plug-ins&quot; on the advanced tracing preference page.</p>
<p>We will now define a template <b> .options</b> file with a
few tracing flags for our new plug-in.</p>
<p>Select the <b>com.example.xyz</b> project created earlier and create a new file
.<b>options</b>. When
the default text editor opens, add the following entries:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="Code">com.example.xyz/debug = true<br>
    com.example.xyz/debug/flag = true<br>
    com.example.xyz/debug/filter = *</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>When this file is saved, open the <b>Preferences-&gt;Advanced Tracing </b> page. Our
plug-in should now show up under &quot;Workspace Plug-ins&quot;. When selected,
it should show the newly defined flags with their default values.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/xyz-tracing.jpg" width="599" height="531"></p>
<p>Creating the <b>.options</b> file only defines the availability flags,
allowing other plug-in developers to define the values of the tracing
properties.&nbsp; You will still need to check the values of your tracing
properties in your plug-in code using <b>Platform.getDebugOption()</b><b>.</b></p>
