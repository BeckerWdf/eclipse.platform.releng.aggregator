<h2>Dependencies page</h2>
<p>The Dependencies page shows the dependencies that your plug-in has on other
plug-ins.&nbsp; The plug-ins your plug-in currently depends on are shown in the
list. You can modify the list by adding more plug-ins (button <b>Add...</b>) or
removing them from the list. Changes in this list will prompt PDE to update the plug-in manifest and
also configure the build path of the project so that the classes of the imported
plug-in are visible to the plug-in under development.</p>
<p>Since the PDE distinguishes between workspace and external plug-ins, the eligible plug-ins will be shown in two separate lists of
checkboxes.</p>
<p>Once you add the plug-in reference to the list, you can browse it by
selecting <b>Open</b> from the pop-up menu or double-clicking on the entry.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/plugin-dependencies.jpg" width="546" height="506"></p>
<p align="left">When you select an entry in the list of required plug-ins, you
can re-export the dependency in the <b>Import Details</b> section. Re-exporting
will make the plug-in visible to plug-ins that import it. You can also be more
specific regarding the version and matching of the requirement. By default, any
plug-in that has the required ID will work. You can add constraints by
specifying the version and whether the version match should be explicitly
specified (you can read more about valid values in the Core ISV guide).</p>
<p align="left">The section in the bottom-right corner can be used to obtain
dependency graph information. You can select the type of information from the
drop-down combo box. The section can be used to check loops in the dependency
graph, fragments that reference your plug-in and other plug-ins that require
your plug-in. In each case, the result will be shown in the list below the combo
box.</p>
