<h2>Runtime page</h2>
<p>The Runtime page shows information about run-time libraries. When packaged, 
platform plug-ins deliver all of their Java classes in JAR libraries. </p>

<p>You can also determine exporting rules for your libraries. By default, no 
classes in your libraries can be seen by others. This is appropriate if your 
plug-in is not meant to be extended. If your classes should be visible to other 
plug-ins, the libraries must be exported. You can export the entire library or 
just a subset of packages.</p>
<p>The first time a class is accessed from one of your plug-in's libraries at 
runtime, the plug-in gets activated.&nbsp; In 3.0, this activation is selective.&nbsp; 
You can specify the conditions when your plug-in should be activated at runtime, 
thus potentially reducing overhead and memory footprint.&nbsp; This 
functionality is only available for plug-ins that have an OSGi bundle 
manifest.mf file.&nbsp; Therefore, if you want to take advantage of this 
functionality, PDE provides a link in the <b>Plug-in Activation</b> section that 
will create a manifest.mf file for your plug-in with all the correct contents on 
the fly.</p>
