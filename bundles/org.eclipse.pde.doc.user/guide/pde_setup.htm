<h1>Setting up the workbench</h1>
<p>To set up the workbench for PDE, we start by assuming that you are using the
default workbench perspective.&nbsp;PDE offers an alternative
perspective that arranges the views differently and defines
placeholders for other views you will likely need (Package Explorer, Hierarchy,
Plug-ins). To change the perspective, use <b>Window-&gt;Open Perspective-&gt;Other...
</b> and
choose <b>Plug-in Development</b> from the offered list.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/pdeperspective.jpg" width="719" height="553" alt="PDE perspective"></p>
<p>In addition to the new perspective, PDE supplies three new views.</p>
<h2>Error Log</h2>
<p>The <b>Error Log</b>  view will capture internal errors thrown by the platform or your code.&nbsp;
This is useful at run-time, since you are likely to cause exceptions during
development.&nbsp; As errors are triggered, they will be added to
the log view and you can examine details by double-clicking on them.&nbsp; You can
also clear the view when you are done with the errors.&nbsp; The same information is stored
in the <b> .metadata</b> location of your workspace in the
<b> .log</b> file, but the Error
Log is much more convenient. Note that you can always restore the content of the
view by reloading the .log file. Entries are sorted in the reverse chronological
order (latest first) and you can bring up the Properties dialog to see entry
details.</p>
<p>Some errors may be hierarchical i.e. there can be a general entry for a
complex problem and a number of child entries listing individual problems in
details.</p>

<h2>Plug-in Registry</h2>
<p>The<b> Plug-in Registry </b>view shows you a read-only view of the plug-in registry of the
instance in which it is running. This view can be useful in the run-time
workbench instance to see whether
your plug-in has been started and what plug-in artifacts (extensions, extension
points, libraries, etc.) are recognized by the platform. Detailed properties of
the selected objects in the Registry view are shown in the Properties view.</p>
<p>The Registry is not shown by default in the PDE perspective.&nbsp; To view
the registry, choose <b>Window-&gt;Show View-&gt;Other... </b>and choose
&quot;Plug-in Registry&quot; from the &quot;PDE Runtime&quot; category in the
Show View dialog. Remember, do it in the instance you launched for testing, not
in the instance you use for development.</p>
