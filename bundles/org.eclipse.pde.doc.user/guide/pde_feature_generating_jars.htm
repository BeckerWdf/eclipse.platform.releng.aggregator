<h3>Creating feature JARs</h3>

<p> Unless you take responsibility for
maintaining the build script yourself, it is best to regenerate new scripts each
time before executing them.&nbsp; This way, changes in folder structure, new files, deleted
files, and new plug-ins will be accounted for.</p>
<p>When Ant scripts are executed from within the wizard, a wizard view will
appear in the active perspective so that you
can see build messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a build is complete, you should see
individual JARs in the plug-in and fragment projects, as well as the feature JAR
that has the following name format: <b> &lt;feature_id&gt;_&lt;feature_version&gt;.jar</b></p>
<p>If there is no change to the structure of the plug-ins, you can also run the build by selecting the
<b>build.xml</b> file and
selecting the &quot;Run Ant&quot; action from the popup menu. The resulting JARs will
be identical in both cases.</p>
