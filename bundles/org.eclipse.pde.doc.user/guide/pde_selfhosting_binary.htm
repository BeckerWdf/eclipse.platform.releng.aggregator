<h1>Binary project self-hosting</h1>
<p CLASS="BodyText">Simple self-hosting is adequate for most standalone
situations and is particularly well-suited to developing against the large
products as targets. However, there are scenarios in which a more advanced
solution is needed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="BodyText">Since external plug-ins are not in the workspace, they
    are not part of the search scope. Therefore, various searches (for interface
    and class references, implementations etc.) return less results than
    expected. Only external libraries that are part of workspace plug-ins' class
    path are visible to Java plug-in.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="BodyText">Closely connected to 1), browsing source code of
    external plug-ins is only possible for plug-ins that are required by
    workspace plug-ins. Other plug-ins are not visible.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="BodyText">Class path is not stable. If you work on a number of
    interdependent plug-in in the workspace, PDE will express these dependencies
    as project references. In contrast, dependencies on external plug-ins will
    be expressed using ECLIPSE_HOME variable and external JARs. If these
    projects are shared using the repository, other developers will be forced to
    replicate this complement even though they do not necessarily need all the
    plug-ins you had in the workspace.</li>
</ol>
<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">The obvious conclusion is that if all the
plug-ins were in the workspace, these shortcomings would all be addressed.
Search would work as expected, source code would be visible for all the classes
and class path would be uniform i.e. would contain only project references.
However, always adding the entire product from a shared repository in source
form is prohibitively slow both for downloading and compilation. For this
reason, a notion of <b>binary projects</b> is introduced.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">Binary projects are regular plug-in projects
that do not contain source code. As such, they are bypassed during compilation
and are only used to address the shortcomings listed above. External plug-ins
are brought into the workspace using the PDE import wizard.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">Before importing binary projects, it is
important to configure PDE for binary self-hosting. Since we will not use
external plug-ins to resolved references, we should disable them in Preferences.
After that, Import wizard is invoked using <b>File-&gt;Import...-&gt;External
Plug-ins and Fragments</b>.&nbsp;</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="center">

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">Most of the time, you will accept default 
values in the first page. By default, you are importing external plug-ins of the 
target run-time workbench as set in the Preferences. The first page of the 
import wizard allows you to change the location of the run-time workbench by 
providing a shortcut to the <b>Plug-in Development-&gt;Target Platform</b> page 
through the <b>Change...</b> button.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">Importing binary projects can cause your 
workspace to be large in size, and the import operation itself can be 
time-consuming depending on the number and content of the plug-ins being 
imported.&nbsp; To get around these problems, PDE has introduced the notion of
<b>importing with linking</b>.&nbsp; If you uncheck the 'Copy plug-in contents 
into the workspace location' checkbox, PDE will not import the contents of the 
plug-ins you selected into the workspace.&nbsp; What it will do instead is 
create projects for these plug-ins in your workspace, and create a linked 
resource for every file that was to be imported.&nbsp; These linked resources 
point to the actual files in the install and will show up in your workspace as 
if they were explicitly imported.&nbsp; You will able to browse them, but you 
won't be able to modify them, as modifying these files will result in the 
modification of the original files.&nbsp; Deleting a binary project will of 
course delete all the linked files contained in it.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">Automatically attaching source code to a JAR 
file and the extracting source archives option require PDE to find the zip file 
containing the source.&nbsp; PDE has two requirements for this task:</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">1. The zip file must be named properly.&nbsp; f 
the library name is xyz.jar, the zip file containing source for that library 
must be named xyzsrc.jar.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">2. The zip file must either be alongside the 
JAR file or in one the declared source code locations. In Eclipse, source code 
is packaged in separate plug-ins, and source code locations are declared using 
the 'org.eclipse.pde.core.source' extension point.&nbsp; PDE automatically goes 
through all the extensions in your target platform, computes all the source code 
locations found in that platform, and adds them to the <b>Plug-in 
Development-&gt;Source Code Locations</b> preference page.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">If you import from a location <b>other than</b> 
the target platform as specified on the <b>Plug-in Development-&gt;Target Platform</b> 
page, and your source code is packaged using the 'org.eclipse.pde.core.source' 
extension points, make sure to add those source code locations <b>manually</b> 
to the <b>Plug-in Development-&gt;Source Code Locations </b>page, so that PDE can 
successfully locate the source.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">Library paths sometimes contain variables, e.g 
$ws$.&nbsp; PDE substitutes values set on the <b>Plug-in Development-&gt;Target 
Environment</b> page to substitute these variables.&nbsp; If these values are 
incompatible with the platform you're importing from, the first page of the 
import wizard provides a shortcut to that preference page through the <b>
Change...</b> button which allows you to modify values on that preference page.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">When Next is pressed, the wizard will compute
all import candidates and make them available in a list of checkboxes. The
actual set of plug-ins you will select depends on the way you self-host.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/binary-import2.gif" alt="Import External Plug-ins wizard - second page" width="490" height="556"></p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">If you are working on plug-ins that are not
already present in the target platform, you will want to select all the choices
(<b>Select All</b>). If some of the plug-ins on the list are already in the
workspace in source form, you will want press <b>Existing Projects</b>, then <b>Invert
Selection</b>. This will result in selecting all the plug-ins that are not in
the workspace already.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">When you press <b>Finish</b>, selected plug-ins
will be imported into the workspace. PDE will also set their class path and
associate source archives with libraries so that you can browse or debug them.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">When there is a large number of binary projects
in the workspace, it is hard to tell them apart from source projects. PDE
provides two complementing ways to handle this problem. It provides for label
decorator that adds a 'binary' icon overlay to the regular project icon to
clearly mark the binary project. You can turn it on in Preferences under
'Workbench-&gt;Label Decorations'. In addition, PDE contributes binary project
filter to Java Explorer view. When engaged, it will hide binary projects and
leave only those you are working on.</p>
