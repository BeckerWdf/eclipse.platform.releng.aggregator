<h1>Simple self-hosting</h1>
<p CLASS="BodyText">Most of the examples in at the beginning of this guide use
simple self-hosting. Resolving plug-in references using external plug-ins is
simple, straightforward and fast. PDE discovers plug-ins and fragments in the
target platform. Users can browse them, use them for references, extensions,
extension points etc.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText">If simple self-hosting is used, external plug-ins are not
part of the workspace and cannot be browsed in the Navigator or Package
Explorer. For that reason, PDE provides a view that fills the gap.&nbsp;</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">The role of the Plug-ins view is to
consistently show the plug-ins that will be passed to the run-time workbench
when running or debugging. Plug-ins that are in the workspace are simply shown
using project icons and no further browsing is possible (the intention was not
to duplicate support available in Package Explorer and Navigator). However,
external plug-ins have full hierarchy and their content can be browsed, editors
can be opened on files (in read-only mode), files and folders can be copied into
the clipboard and drag-and-drop can be used between the view and other
compatible views. This way, Plug-ins becomes natural extension to Package
Explorer.</p>

<p CLASS="BodyText" align="left">When a workspace plug-in has a dependency on an
external plug-in, its class path is computed by PDE by adding external JARs
qualified using ECLIPSE_HOME variable. This variable is managed by PDE and
points to the root of the target platform's install tree.</p>
