<h2>Building plug-ins, fragments and features using update site editor</h2>
<p>The update site editor uses the same concepts seen in the other PDE editors. 
However, it is different from these editors in that it has an additional page 
that controls how plug-ins, fragments and features in other projects within the 
workspace are build and placed in the update site project's folders.</p>
<p>Update site editor has a special page call Build:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/site-build.gif" alt="Feature manifest editor - Overview page" width="549" height="476"></p>
<p align="left">The assumption is that there are features in the workspace that 
can be built to create feature and plug-in archives as required by the Eclipse 
update manager. This page maintains the list of these projects that need to be 
built and also provides buttons to initiate the build.</p>
<p align="left">Update site build setup starts by adding the feature projects 
that will be built into this site. This is accomplished by using the Add... 
button. A wizard will be opened with the choice of existing feature projects. 
Since the update site project can be created outside the particular workspace 
(and shared among several workspace), some feature entries in this list may have 
'shaded' icons. This indicates that a particular feature (id + version) cannot 
be currently located in the workspace. This is fine, because these features will 
simply be skipped during the build. This capability allows us to build and 
maintain portion of the update site in each workspace.</p>
<p align="left">When features are added to the list, they will appear with a 
checkbox. Each feature in the list will be subject to build, but only checked 
features will also appear in the site map. This is a very important distinction: 
features can include other features, and all need to be built and present in the 
update site, but typically only roots are listed in the map file. When a feature 
in this list is checked, an entry will be automatically added to the map file 
(you can see the entry show up in the Outline view and also in the Features 
page).</p>
<p align="left">Build Control section contains two build buttons: <b>Build</b> 
and <b>Rebuild All</b>. The former will build features that changed since the 
last time we pressed the button, while the later will always rebuild all 
features. If 'Scrub output folders before the build' checkbox is selected, this 
button will also delete all the archives from the destination folders prior to 
creating the new ones. Be careful with this checkbox when sharing the update 
site between multiple workspace, because you don't want to loose archives build 
by another workspace.</p>
<p align="left">In addition to these two buttons, it is possible to rebuild a 
single feature by selecting it and selecting the appropriate item from the 
pop-up menu.</p>
<p align="left">When features are built, the build does not stop at the features 
themselves. It will also build all the plug-ins and fragments referenced by the 
features. Built archives (JARs) will be placed in the provided destination 
folders (features in <b>features</b>, plug-ins/fragments in <b>plugins</b>, 
respectively).</p>
<p align="left">During the build, a progress monitor dialog will open, 
displaying build progress. In case of the failure, you can follow the <b>Build 
Log</b> hyperlink to see what happened.</p>
<p align="left">If you ever wander where all this information shown in the Build 
page is saved, you can see it in <b>.sitebuild</b> folder in the update site 
project. This is also the place where the build log file is placed. If you are 
in Package Explorer view, you may need to turn off the &quot;.*&quot; filter to see the 
folder.</p>
