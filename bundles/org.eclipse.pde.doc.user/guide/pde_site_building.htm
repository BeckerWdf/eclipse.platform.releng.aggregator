<h2>Building plug-ins, fragments and features using update site editor</h2>
<p align="left">
Building an update site is a relatively simple task and most of the work is done 
on the <b>Features</b> page of the update site editor.</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="images/site-features.png" ></p>
<p align="center">
&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">
Features added to the <b>Features to Build</b> section will be built recursively 
when you press <b>Build All</b>.&nbsp; This means that the features and all the 
plug-ins and fragments they include will be built in one batch operation.&nbsp; 
The feature JARs end up in the <b>features/</b> folder of your site project and 
the plug-in JARs are placed in the <b>plugins/</b> folder of your site project.</p>
<p align="left">
If you would like to build a subset of those features, there is a <b>Build</b> 
action available through the context menu of that section.</p>
<p align="left">
If you are dealing with features that include other features, only the root 
feature needs to be listed, since its child features will automatically be 
built.</p>
<p align="left">
Not all features on the update site may be meant for general consumption.&nbsp; 
Therefore, the features you intend to publish need to be explicitly dragged and 
dropped in the <b>Features to Publish</b> section.</p>
<p align="left">
For easy browsing of your features on your update site, you can create 
categories and organize your published features in these categories.&nbsp; A 
feature may appear in &gt;= 0 categories.</p>
<p align="left">
To preview on what your website would look like, save the site.xml file and open 
the index.html file at the root of your site project in a browser.</p>
