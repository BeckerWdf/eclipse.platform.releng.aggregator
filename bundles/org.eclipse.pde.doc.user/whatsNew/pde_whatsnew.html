<title>PDE What's New for 2.1</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2>What's New for 2.1</h2>
<p>[This section should make interesting reading for an end user of Eclipse 2.0
who has just switched to 2.1 (or is contemplating switching). It should inform
them the most interesting and most significant visible changes that came along
with 2.1. The section should be complete, in that no interesting, significant,
visible change should go unmentioned. It differs in tone from the Tips and
Tricks section in that it only covers things that are new for 2.1, and that it
only deals with things that users would feel like was a significant improvement.
Each item should stand by itself, so that the items can be easily rearranged and
subsetted. Screen snaps should be GIFs and must be no wider than 466 pixels.]</p>
<p>[This section is still preliminary. The material here is lifted from the M2
through M5 &quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; bulletins.]</p>
<p>[Formatting changes: add horizontal line between each item; change font and
size throughout.]</p>

      dependent plug-ins</td>
    <td width="70%" align="left" valign="top">The new <b>Plug-in Development /
      Java Build Path Control</b> preference controls whether new plug-in
      development projects will use a dynamically computed build classpath entry
      rather than an explicit list of required plug-in JAR libraries (the
      default). Turning this preference on makes the Java project build
      classpath much less fragile, and visually groups together libraries for
      required plug-ins.

      wizards for exporting plug-in and features. Choose <b>File &gt; Export

    <td width="70%" align="left" valign="top">PDE now supports building and
      maintaining Update Manager update sites. Use the new project wizard <b>Plug-in
      Development &gt; Update Site Project</b> to create a dedicated project
      with all the relevant files including the site map (site.xml) file. The
      site map editor creates the needed feature and plug-in JARs. Once built,
      the site is operational directly from the workspace and can be tested
      using Update Manager (<b>Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; Update Manager</b>).
      And with Eclipse FTP/WebDAV Support installed, you can upload everything
      to a remote update server.
