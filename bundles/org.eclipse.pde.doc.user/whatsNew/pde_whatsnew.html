<h2>What's New in 2.1</h2>

<p>Here are some of the more interesting or significant changes made to PDE for 
the 2.1 release of Eclipse since 2.0:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="600" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">
  <tr>
    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right"><b>Improved way to reference
      dependent plug-ins</b></td>
    <td width="80%" align="left" valign="top">The new <b>Plug-in Development /
      Java Build Path Control</b> preference controls whether new plug-in
      development projects will use a dynamically computed build classpath entry
      rather than an explicit list of required plug-in JAR libraries (the
      default). Turning this preference on makes the Java project build classpath much less fragile, and visually groups together libraries for
      required plug-ins. It also makes the classpath highly dynamic in that it 
    instantly reacts to the changes in the self-hosting style (external plug-ins 
    versus imported binary projects).<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/required-plug-in-entries.gif" width="242" height="151" alt="Project using Required plug-in entries container"></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right"><b>Exporting deployable plug-ins
      and features</b></td>
    <td width="80%" align="left" valign="top">There are new <b>File &gt; Export</b>
      wizards for exporting plug-in and features. Choose File-&gt;Export-&gt;Deployable 
    plug-ins and fragments to export selected plug-ins to a ZIP file that can be 
    easily unzipped into any Eclipse-based product. Similarly, choose <b>File &gt; Export
      &gt; Deployable features</b> to export selected features and their
      plug-ins.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right"><b>Importing with linking</b></td>
    <td width="80%" align="left" valign="top">Importing external plug-ins and 
    fragments can be much faster and would not greatly increase the size of your 
    workspace if you import with linking.&nbsp; This new option can be used by 
    unchecking the 'copy plug-in content into your workspace area' checkbox in 
    the 'Import External Plug-ins and Fragments' wizard.&nbsp; 'Importing with 
    linking' means that the import operation will not copy the resources being 
    imported into your workspace.&nbsp; It will simply create links to the files 
    being imported.&nbsp; You will be able to browse these linked resources, as if 
    they had been copied into your workspace.&nbsp; However, they are physically not 
    there on your file system, so you will not be able to modify them.&nbsp; Beware 
    of operations that depend on files being physically in your workspace, as 
    they will not work on linked resources.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right"><b>Support for creating update
      sites</b></td>
    <td width="80%" align="left" valign="top">PDE now supports building and
      maintaining Update Manager update sites. Use the new project wizard <b>Plug-in
      Development &gt; Update Site Project</b> to create a dedicated project
      with all the relevant files including the site map (site.xml) file. The
      site map editor creates the required entries in the map and also builds the needed feature and plug-in JARs. Once built,
      the site is operational directly from the workspace and can be tested
      using Update Manager (<b>Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; Update Manager</b>).
      And with Eclipse FTP/WebDAV Support installed, you can upload everything
      to a remote update server.<p><img border="0" src="images/site-builder.gif" width="466" height="321" alt="update site editor"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right"><b>manifest file validation</b></td>
    <td width="80%" align="left" valign="top">Manifest (plugin.xml/fragment.xml) 
    files in plug-in projects that have a PDE nature can now be validated to 
    flag semantic errors such as unknown extension points, illegal attributes 
    for extensions, missing required attributes for extensions, etc.&nbsp; The 
    list of possible problems that PDE can detect are found on the <b>Plug-ins</b> 
    tab of the <b>Plug-in Development &gt; Compilers</b> preference page, where the 
    level for each problem can be set to one of 'Ignore', 'Error', or 'Warning'.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right"><b>Plug-in Search</b></td>
    <td width="80%" align="left" valign="top">PDE contributes a tab to the 
    Search dialog, where you can search for plug-ins, fragments, extension 
    points and extensions.&nbsp; Scope of search can extend beyond the workspace 
    to external plug-ins and fragments.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right"><b>Compute Dependency Extent</b></td>
    <td width="80%" align="left" valign="top">PDE can now easily determine the 
    reason why your plug-in depends on plug-in X.&nbsp; Through the function 
    'Compute Dependency Extent' found in the context menu of the 'Dependencies' 
    page of the manifest editor, PDE will find and display all the Java types 
    and extension points provided by plug-in X to your plug-in.&nbsp; This is a 
    good tool to determine the extent to which you need this plug-in, and it 
    might help you refactor your plug-ins.&nbsp; Also, it would help you check 
    if you are using any internal (non-API) types of plug-in X, which might be 
    undesirable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right"><b>Find Unused Dependencies</b></td>
    <td width="80%" align="left" valign="top">This function is available through 
    the context menu of the 'Dependencies' page of the manifest editor.&nbsp; It 
    will find all the plug-ins listed as dependencies for your plug-in, but need 
    to be removed because they are unused by your plug-in.&nbsp; The removal of 
    such stale dependencies will help minimize your plug-in's list of 
    dependencies and hence improve performance.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right"><b>Dependencies View</b></td>
    <td width="80%" align="left" valign="top">PDE now provides a Dependencies 
    view, which can be invoked by selecting a plugin.xml/fragment.xml file and 
    choosing 'Open dependencies' from the context menu.&nbsp; It will display a 
    tree showing all the plug-ins needed to be activated before you plug-in is 
    activated.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="20%" valign="top" align="right"><b>Extending Java Search Scope</b></td>
    <td width="80%" align="left" valign="top">Java search scope is limited to 
    workspace projects and the external libraries they reference.&nbsp; In order 
    to add arbitrary plug-in libraries to the search scope, go to the Plug-ins 
    view.&nbsp; Select the external projects of choice and choose 'Add to Java 
    Search' from the context menu.</td>
  </tr>
