    <td><p>Variables can be displayed using 
        columns or a standard tree. To toggle columns on/off use the view menu's 
        <strong>Layout &gt; Show Columns</strong> action. You can select the columns 
        to be displayed using the <strong>Layout &gt; Select Columns</strong> 
        action. Recently changed variables are displayed with a yellow background 
        (controlled by the &quot;Changed value background color&quot; user preference 
        via the <strong>Run/Debug</strong> preference page). The Java debugger 
        supports editing of Strings and primitive values inline.</p>
