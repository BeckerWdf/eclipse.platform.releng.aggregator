<p>Here are descriptions of some of the more interesting or
significant changes made to the Eclipse Platform for the 3.1 release of
Eclipse. They are grouped into:</p>

<li><a href="#SWT">SWT Changes</a></li>
<li><a href="#TeamCVS">Team/CVS Changes</a></li>
<li><a href="#Ant">Ant Changes</a></li>

      <td><p align="right"><b>Significant performance enhancements</b></p></td>
      <td><p>Performance has been significantly enhanced
      across the board compared to the Eclipse 3.0 release.</p><p>We have also added debugging
      support that can continually monitor performance while the workbench
      is running, and have made pervasive benchmarking tests
      part of the standard test suites. The results of these tests are linked off of the download
      page for each build. Here is an example of part of the output:</p>

          bi-directional text</b></p></td>
      <td><p>Support for bi-directional languages (BIDI), 
          has been extended across the platform. Window layout orientation can 
          be configured from the command line, and a suitable default orientation 
          is inferred from the locale. Note that SWT fully supports BIDI on Windows 
          only.</p>

      <td> <p>Applications can now access a platform history of operations that can be undone 
          by using an API in org.eclipse.core.commands.operations. IUndoableOperation 
          defines the interface for operations that can be undone and redone. 
          Views and editors can provide access to the undo and redo support by 
          using the UndoActionHandler and RedoActionHandler provided in org.eclipse.ui.operations.

      <td><p>The Preferences and Properties dialogs now 
        have a field for filtering the pages displayed to just those that have 
        names or keywords that match the specified prefix. The example below shows 
        matches for the keyword &quot;tab&quot;.</p> <p><img src="images/preferences.png" alt="Screenshot of new preferences dialog" ></p></td>

      <td><p>General support for linking preference and 
        property pages allows pages with related settings to refer to each other 
        and provide quick access to the other page. Combined with web-style forward 
        and backward navigation in the top right-hand corner, it is now much easier 
        to work with a set of related preference pages. </p>

        open for a given file, the file's content type is now taken into account. 
        Editors may now advertise that they are capable of working on certain 
        content types as well as their traditional file name and extensions. </p></td>

        in Eclipse with names containing colon ('<b>:</b>') and backslash ('<b>\</b>') characters. 
        Such characters are now permitted when running Eclipse on operating systems 
        such as Linux that allow such characters in file names. Care must be taken 
        when file names must be meaningful across multiple operating environments; 
        Windows, in particular, does not allow either of these characters in file 
        names. </p>

      <td><p>You can now view and change operating system-specific file 
        attributes such as the executable bit (Unix-based) and the archive bit (Windows).
	    CVS will now preserve these attributes when you check files 
        out of, or commit files to, a repository, and import wizards will preserve 
        the attributes of files and directories that are imported from a local 
        file system.</p>

          is used when creating new text files. You can provide a single setting 
          for the entire workspace, or for a given project. In addition, line 
          delimiter conversions can now be applied to projects, folders, and files, 
          not just to the contents of a single editor.</p>

    <tr> 
      <td> <p align="right"><b>Single JAR 
          plug-ins</b></p></td>
      <td> <p>Eclipse now provides the ability to ship 
          a plug-in packaged as a single JAR file rather than as a directory of 
          files. Think of this as folding the plug-in metadata (<tt>plugin.xml</tt> etc.) 
          into its code JAR. This move has a number of benefits ranging from smaller 
          footprint to easier/faster install to fitting better with the standard 
          Java notion of JARs.</p>
        <p>In Eclipse 3.1 most plug-ins are shipped as JARs in all distributions. 
          This format is the new best practice for Eclipse packaging.</p>

        available only in other views are now right at your finger tips in the editor 
        context menu. For example, you can commit files to CVS or run and debug 
        Java programs and Ant builds from the editor's context menu.</p>

        views in Eclipse, just press Ctrl+Shift+L to see a full list of the currently 
        available key bindings. This is a great way to learn what is available 
        in the UI and to speed up your productivity by learning more key bindings. 
        This information is also available in the improved <b>General &gt; Keys</b> 
        preference page. </p>

          that support it) now has improved "detached view" support. It is now much 
          easier to place views wherever desired, including over another Eclipse 
          window. </p>
        <p>Right-click on the view to be moved and select &quot;Detached&quot; from the menu.

          is now more consistent with the error dialogs displayed elsewhere in 
          the workbench. Extra buttons are shown when additional information is 
          available, such as this dialog, which results from a failed CVS operation:</p>

      <p>In order to run a standalone SWT application, the native libraries must be placed 
      on the java library path.  If you use the SWT Binary and Source download this is resolved for you 
      but sometimes it is useful to build against the SWT plug-in from the Eclipse SDK.
      In Eclipse 3.0, standalone SWT developers added the native libraries using -Djava.library.path.  
      In Eclipse 3.1, since the native libraries are inside a JAR, developers cannot 
      easily locate the libraries.</p>
      <p>To run and debug your SWT application using the SWT plug-in from
      Eclipse, you can use the SWT application launcher to locate the native libraries. A shortcut to the 
      launcher is available in the context menu of your Java class via

      <td> <p>The <b>Breakpoints</b> view allows breakpoints 
          to be grouped by type, project, file, or working sets, and supports 
          nested groupings. You can use breakpoint working sets to group breakpoints 
          into problem-specific sets that can be quickly enabled and disabled 
          as a whole. Newly-created breakpoints are automatically placed into 
          the default breakpoint working set (displayed in <b>bold</b>). You can copy 
          and paste and drag and drop breakpoints between breakpoint working sets, 
          and a breakpoint can be placed in more than one breakpoint working set.</p>
