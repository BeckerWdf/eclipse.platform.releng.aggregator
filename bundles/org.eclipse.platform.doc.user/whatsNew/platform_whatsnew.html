<h2>What's New in Luna</h2>
<p>Here are descriptions of some of the more interesting or significant changes 
made to the Eclipse Platform for the Luna (4.4) release of Eclipse.</p>
<p>
Plug-in developers will also be interested in the corresponding 
<a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/whatsNew/platform_isv_whatsnew.html">What's new</a>
document in the plug-in developer's guide.

 <tr id="protect-option">
    <td class="title">New protection options for Eclipse</td>
    <td class="content">
     	A new launcher parameter named <b>-protect</b> has been introduced and it accepts the following values:
		<ul>
		<li><b>-protect root</b> can be used to prevent Eclipse from being started as a root user, 
		either directly or via programs that run with administrative privileges like 'sudo'. 
		This option is currently implemented only on Linux/UNIX based platforms.</li>
		<li><b>-protect master</b> can be used to prevent starting of the master instance in a shared install configuration.
		This option can be used on all platforms supported by Eclipse.</li>	
		</ul>
		<p>The above options can either be set in the launcher's <b>.ini</b> file or can be used directly from the command line (e.g eclipse -protect root). 
		See <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=379102">bug 379102</a> for more details.</p>

   <tr id="e4-views-2">
    <td class="title">Improved the handling of minimized views</td>
    <td class="content">      
        It was hard to dismiss the minimized views that are brought up by the framework.
        The most common (and justifiably complained about) use case for
        this is having the Debug view overlay the editor when it hits a breakpoint. This has
        been refactored to match the 3.x behavior more closely.

    <td class="content">Thanks to the efforts of the

              href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=388878">bug
                388878</a>), we now provide signed Windows and Mac
              executables for the Eclipse SDK. This improves the initial impression of the
              software, as well as improves security for you, since
              there is no need to disable "Gatekeeper" or other
              security measures of the operating systems.

      New examples have been added to the Platform Debug git repository. The <code>org.eclipse.debug.examples.mixedmode</code> project demonstrates

     within the same file? Finally, <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8009">Bug 8009</a> has been addressed! 
     You can now split / unsplit the currently active editor. Just use one of the new key bindings supplied in Luna:
     <ul>
     <li><b>Ctrl+_</b> splits the editor one above the other</li>
     <li><b>Ctrl+{</b> splits the editor side by side</li>
     <li>Re-applying the command to an already split editor reverts it to only have one pane.</li>

  <tr id="minimized-stack-option"> 
    <td class="title">New option for minimized stacks</td>
    <td class="content">
    We've extended the MinMaxAddon to have two different display modes:
    <ul>
    <li>Use Overlays: This is the current mode where showing a view in a
    minimized stack opens it in a 'fly out', overlaying part of the
    presentation.</li>
    <li>Show in the Original Location: This is a new mode that will temporarily put the
    stack back into the perspective layout while one of its views is active. This
    has the advantage that the minimized view won't overlay anything in the
    current presentation (e.g. your editor...).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In order to access the new mode, right-click on the <b>Restore</b> button
    of a minimized stack and select the <b>Show in the Original Location</b> menu item (see image
    below). Note that this change is global, so once it's set, all minimized
    stacks will use the selected mode.</p>
    <p><img src="images/restore-btn.png" alt=""/></p>

    <p>Here's what the current mode looks like:</p>
    <p><img src="images/use-overlays.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p>Here's what the new mode looks like. Note how the editor
    has been pushed to the right rather than being obscured:</p>
    <p><img src="images/no-overlays.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p>
    We're really interested in your feedback on this! The initial response
    has been positive enough that we're considering making the non-overlay
    mode the default. What do you think? (Post your comments on <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=426556">bug 426556</a>).

      A new dark CSS theme based on a community contribution has been added. This popular community
      theme demonstrates the capabilities of the current CSS styling. This new theme helps the Platform team
      to continue to improve these capabilities.
	  </p>	
      <p>
      The platform also supports that projects can extend existing themes like the dark theme with settings for fitting 
      syntax coloring. Several editors, i.e., the Java, C/C++ and Lua editor,  already contribute styling for the dark theme.
      See <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=433475">bug 433475</a> for details.

     The CSS support for the 3.x theme element definitions is now available (the CSS bridge), for more details see the following bugs:
	 <ul>
	  <li><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=419016" target="_blank">Bug 419016</a></li>

	  <li><a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=429338" target="_blank">Bug 429338</a></li>
     </ul>
	 The use cases for the bridge:
	 <ul>
		<li>
			Using the Color and FontDefinitions in the CSS style sheet:
			<p>
				<img src="images/css-bridge/using-definitions.png" alt=""/>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Overriding of the definitions in the CSS style sheet:
			<p>
				<img src="images/css-bridge/overriding-definitions.png" alt=""/>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Adding the new definitions with the CSS style sheet:
			<p>
				<img src="images/css-bridge/new-definitions.png" alt=""/>
			</p>
		</li>
	 </ul>
	 The 3.x theme definitions overridden or added in the CSS style sheet are merged with the current 3.x theme.<br/>
	 After switching the 3.x theme they are re-merged with the new theme.<br/><br/>
	 The new definitions added with the CSS file (the last use case) are available in the CSS theme that provides it.<br/>
	 After switching the CSS theme the definitions can be unavailable in the theme registries when the new theme doesn't re-define it.
	 So using such definitions out of the CSS files, we have to be prepared for such situation and use proper default values in the case when some definitions are missing.
