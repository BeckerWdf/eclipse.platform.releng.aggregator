<h2>What's New in Luna</h2>
<p>Here are descriptions of some of the more interesting or significant changes 
made to the Eclipse Platform for the Luna (4.4) release of Eclipse.</p>
<p>
Plug-in developers will also be interested in the corresponding

    <td class="title">Contribute E4 Views into the IDE</td>
    <td class="content">
      As part of our goal to remove some of the barriers between e4-based code and the IDE
      we've just added a new element 'e4view' into the <code>org.eclipse.ui.views</code>
      extension point. This allows you to declare a new view for the IDE whose implementation
      is done in the e4 style (i.e. an annotated POJO).
      <p>
        <img src="images/new-e4view-extension.png" alt="new extension"/>
      </p><p>
        The new type of extension is identical to the original 'view' except for relaxing the
        requirement that the 'class' implement IViewPart.
      </p><p>
        This is the first trial run for this type of extension. Once we are sure we have the pattern
        correct, we'll make similar changes to other extension points such as <code>org.eclipse.ui.menus</code>.
      </p><p>
        For those that are unaware of the e4 way of coding, here's what the implementation of an e4 view
        looks like:
      </p>
      <pre>
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import org.eclipse.e4.ui.di.Focus;
import org.eclipse.swt.SWT;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Composite;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Label;

public class RealE4View {
	Label label;

	@PostConstruct
	void createView(Composite parent) {
		label = new Label(parent, SWT.BORDER);	
		label.setText("Testing");
	}

	@Focus
	void setFocus() {
		label.setFocus();
	}
}
      </pre>
      <p>
        Note how it's a simple POJO and how few dependencies it has; this has already proven itself as
        a far more convenient way to write the code and has great advantages in testing (because of its
        few dependencies).

    <td class="title">Tweaking the UX</td>
    <td class="content">
      We've finally gotten to the point where we can return and address some of the current pain
      points you all see when using Eclipse 4. This will be part of our focus for each milestone
      in Luna...while not necessarily 'New' these changes *are* 'Noteworthy'...;-).
      <p>
        First up is fixing how we handle minimized views that are brought up by the framework
        being hard to dismiss. The most common (and justifiably complained about) use case for
        this is having the Debug view overlay the editor when it hits a breakpoint. This has
        been refactored to match the 3.x behavior more closely and should now work as expected.
      </p><p>
        Next up will be re-enabling the ability to reorder the perspectives on the perspective bar.

    <td class="content">Thanks to the efforts of the
              Eclipse Foundation (see <a

                388878</a>), we now provide signed Windows and Mac
              executables for the Eclipse SDK. This improves the initial impression of the
              software, as well as improves security for you, since
              there is no need to disable "Gatekeeper" or other
              security measures of the operating systems.

     Finally, <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8009">Bug 8009</a> has been addressed! You can now split / unsplit
     the currently active editor. Just use one of the new key bindings
     supplied in Luna:
     <ul>
     <li><b>Ctrl+_</b> splits the editor one above the other</li>
     <li><b>Ctrl+{</b> splits the editor side by side</li>
     <li>Re-applying the command to an already split editor reverts it to only have one pane.</li>

  <tr id="minimized-stack-option"> 
    <td class="title">New option for minimized stacks</td>
    <td class="content">
    We've extended the MinMaxAddon to have two different display modes:
    <ul>
    <li>Use Overlays: This is the current mode where showing a view in a
    minimized stack opens it in a 'fly out', overlaying part of the
    presentation.</li>
    <li>Show in the Original Location: This is a new mode that will temporarily put the
    stack back into the perspective layout while one of its views is active. This
    has the advantage that the minimized view won't overlay anything in the
    current presentation (e.g. your editor...).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In order to access the new mode, right-click on the <b>Restore</b> button
    of a minimized stack and select the <b>Show in the Original Location</b> menu item (see image
    below). Note that this change is global, so once it's set, all minimized
    stacks will use the selected mode.</p>
    <p><img src="images/restore-btn.png" alt=""/></p>

    <p>Here's what the current mode looks like:</p>
    <p><img src="images/use-overlays.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p>Here's what the new mode looks like. Note how the editor
    has been pushed to the right rather than being obscured:</p>
    <p><img src="images/no-overlays.png" alt=""/></p>
    <p>
    We're really interested in your feedback on this! The initial response
    has been positive enough that we're considering making the non-overlay
    mode the default. What do you think? (Post your comments on <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=426556">bug 426556</a>).

      A new experimental CSS theme based on a community contribution has been added. This popular community
      theme demonstrates the capabilities of the current CSS styling. This new theme helps the Platform team
      to continue to improve these capabilities.
     
      <p>
          CSS theming in Eclipse 4 does currently not allow to configure the syntax highlighting in text editors (e.g. 
          the Java editor), so it is recommended to use the dark theme together with additional settings as for 
          example provided by the <a href="http://eclipsecolorthemes.org/">Eclipse color theme project</a>.

     </ul>
	 The use cases for the bridge:
	 <ul>
		<li>
			Using the Color and FontDefinitions in the CSS style sheet:
			<p>
				<img src="images/css-bridge/using-definitions.png" alt=""/>
			</p>

		<li>
			Overriding of the definitions in the CSS style sheet:
			<p>
				<img src="images/css-bridge/overriding-definitions.png" alt=""/>

		</li>
		<li>
			Adding the new definitions with the CSS style sheet:
			<p>
				<img src="images/css-bridge/new-definitions.png" alt=""/>
			</p>
		</li>
	 </ul>
	 The 3.x theme definitions overridden or added in the CSS style sheet are merged with the current 3.x theme.<br/>
	 After switching the 3.x theme they are re-merged with the new theme.<br/><br/>
	 The new definitions added with the CSS file (the last use case) are available in the CSS theme that provides it.<br/>
	 After switching the CSS theme the definitions can be unavailable in the theme registries when the new theme doesn't re-define it.
	 So using such definitions out of the CSS files, we have to be prepared for such situation and use proper default values in the case when some definitions are missing.
