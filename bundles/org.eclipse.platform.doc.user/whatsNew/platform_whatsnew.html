features that are new since the Indigo (3.7) release are included here, including
some functionality that was available in previous technology preview releases of Eclipse Platform 4.
They are grouped into:

    <td class="content">
      When you detach a view or editor into its own separate window, it now
      has all the capabilities of a normal workbench window. They now support multiple stacks of
      views separated by sashes with arbitrary layouts. The detached parts will remain synchronized
      with the master window that they were detached from. This is especially handy for people developing
      with two or more monitors, so they can spread views across several monitors and keep them synchronized.

      launch configuration data, so no migration is needed.

      contributors can set a warning state with a message for their tabs / groups - possibly warning users about set options
      that might be problematic, but do not necessarily need to prevent launching.

      Significant performance enhancements have been made in the Platform user interface in this milestone. In particular, some applications
      that were experiencing slow editor opening, closing, and switching are now much faster. Editor selection changes and the <b>Open Resource</b>
      dialog have also been made faster. A number of leaks have been addressed to avoid long-running applications don't run out of memory.
