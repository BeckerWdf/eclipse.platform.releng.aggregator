    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="left"><b>Multi-drag sash</b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top">
	A new sash mechanism has been introduced that works directly with the workbench model. This cuts
	down on the number of platform widgets needed to manage a complete sash-based layout, and 
	has a much simpler implementation.
	<p>
	As an added bonus you can now place the cursor at the intersection of two or more sashes and
	drag them all at the same time. When you are going to be dragging multiple sashes, the cursor
	will change to one with 4-way arrows.

    <td width="70%" valign="top">A specialized container has been introduced to allow
    the UI to properly represent the editor area. This affordance lets the user know that this
    area behaves differently - for example the entire area can be maximized, and all views and
    editors within the area will be affected.
	<p>
	This is an early implementation, and there will be a much more polished presentation coming in M4.
	At minimum we won't be taking up the space unless the editor area is split.

      Editors can now be detached into their own windows as of 4.1 M5. The detached 
      editor will not be treated any differently from an editor
      contained within the workbench window. This resolves 
      <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8886">bug 8886</a>,
      one of the platform's oldest and most voted for enhancements.

  <tr id="model-translations">

    <td class="content">
	The workbench model now supports native language support similar to what
	is available for extensions in <tt>plugin.xml</tt>. In contrast to
	Eclipse 3.x, the translations are done on demand and not on startup of the
	application. This opens up the possibility of changing translations on the fly while the

    <td class="title">Shared area polish</td>
    <td class="content">
	Based on the almost unanimous feedback that the border around a <i>shared area</i>
	was both confusing and a waste of pixels, we've done some significant polish here
	(the <i>shared area</i> was known as the <i>editor area</i> in 3.x where it can't contain views).
	<p>
	First, you no longer see any 'area' indication if there is only a single stack there.
	</p>
	<p>
	If there is more than one stack in the shared area, you see the area's boundary but with
	less wasted space. There is now a 'fly out' hover area that will show the 
	min/max buttons. Let us know what you think!

	empty space in the tab area.

	You will see some polish on the various CSS themes based on recent feedback. The

	We have	also been tightening up some of the over-use of whitespace throughout the workbench presentation.

        The <b>Problems</b> view icon now indicates whether the view contains warnings or errors.

        <p><b>Note:</b> Currently the icon only updates if the view has been activated before. This
