<h2>What's New in 2.1</h2>
<p>[This section should make interesting reading for an end user of Eclipse 2.0
who has just switched to 2.1 (or is contemplating switching). It should inform
them the most interesting and most significant visible changes that came along
with 2.1. The section should be complete, in that no interesting, significant,
visible change should go unmentioned. It differs in tone from the Tips and
Tricks section in that it only covers things that are new for 2.1, and that it
only deals with things that users would feel like was a significant improvement.
Each item should stand by itself, so that the items can be easily rearranged and
subsetted. Screen snaps should be GIFs and must be no wider than 466 pixels.]</p>
<p>[This section is still preliminary. The material here is lifted from the M2
through M5 &quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; bulletins.]</p>
<p>[Formatting changes: add horizontal line between each item; change font and
size throughout.]</p>

      using <b>Workbench / Keys</b> preference page. Emacs users will find a
      predefined set of key bindings awaiting them.

      navigation history. If you open a second editor while you're editing away,
      you can use <b>Navigate &gt; Backward</b> to get back, or press the back
      button on the workbench toolbar. The back button on your mouse also does
      the trick as along as it sends the standard ALT+LeftArrow key sequence.

      supports line numbers, cursor-line highlighting, print margin, annotation
      highlighting, and an overview ruler. All of these can be configured from
      the <b>Workbench / Editors / Text Editor</b> preference page.

    <td width="70%" valign="top" align="left">The resource Navigator view is no
      longer tightly linked to the currently open editor by default. This means
      that closing or switching editors does not change the selection in the
      Navigator view, which many found disorienting. Toggle the <b>Link with
      Editor</b> button in the Navigator view toolbar to tie the Navigator view
      to always show the current file being edited.

    <td width="70%" valign="top" align="left">The new <b>Navigate &gt; Show In</b>
      action provides a uniform way to navigate from an open editor to a view
      showing the corresponding file (e.g., in the resource Navigator view), or
      from a file selected in one view to the same file in a different view
      (e.g., from the resource Navigator view to the Java Packages Explorer
      view).

    <td width="70%" valign="top" align="left">There is a new Ant View (<b>Window
      &gt; Show View &gt; Ant</b>) that makes it easier to run Ant scripts. The
      Ant view has been completely redesigned and streamlined to simplify
      running a single Ant target. The view also includes a search button for
      finding Ant build files in the workspace to add to the view.

      configurations</b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top" align="left">
      <p>External tools have been completely migrated to use launch
      configurations. The <b>Run &gt; External Tools</b> drop-down menu now
      appears and works in the same fashion as the run and debug drop-down
      menus. The output from external tools now appears in the standard Console
      view. External tools can now be run in the background, by a separate
      thread. This means that you can let an Ant build run or launch an external
      program and still continue to work in the Eclipse IDE.</p>

  <tr>
    <td width="30%" valign="top" align="right"><b>More flexible project layouts</b></td>
    <td width="70%" valign="top" align="left">There is now improved support for
      dealing with externally imposed restrictions on how the files in a
      workspace project are laid out in the local file system. When creating a
      folder (or file), you can link it to an existing location in the file
      system outside of the workspace. This is done using the Advanced section
      on the New Folder (and New File) wizards. This is useful for integrating
      with external libraries or source code directories that cannot readily be
      copied into an Eclipse workspace.
