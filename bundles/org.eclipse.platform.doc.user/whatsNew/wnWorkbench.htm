What's new in 2.0</H1>
<P CLASS="Para">
There are numerous new features and changes to existing features in the new 
Eclipse Workbench. The following lists some of them.
</P>
<dl>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Menu reorganization</dt>
  <dd>The Workbench menus have been reorganized as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>The Perspective menu has been removed, with its items moving to the 
      	<b>Window</b> menu.
      <li>There are several new menu items in the <b>File</b> and <b>Edit</b> 
      	menus. Some of these menu items were previously found in the navigator 
      	view context menu and in editor context menus.
      <li>There is a new <b>Navigate</b> menu.
      <li>There is a new <b>Search</b> menu.      
    </ul>  
  </dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Recently used file list</dt> 
  <dd>The <b>File</b> menu now shows the most recently opened files. You
  	can specify the size of this list on the <b>Workbench > Editors</b> 
  	preference page.</dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Single click activation</dt>
  <dd>You now have the option to activate files with a <a href="../tasks/topenmode.htm">single click</a>
  	instead of a double mouse click. See the Workbench preference page
  	for related settings.
  </dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Toolbar rearrange</dt>
  <dd>You may now <a href="../tasks/ttoolbars.htm">rearrange</a> sections of the main toolbar using the mouse.
  </dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Accessibility</dt>
  <dd><a href="../concepts/accessibility/accessmain.htm">Accessibility</a> features have been added to Eclipse. Accessibility features 
  	help people with a physical disability or those with special needs to use 
  	software products successfully. Some of these features can help everyone
  	use Eclipse more effectively. The <b>Window > Keyboard Shortcuts</b> menu for
  	example lists keyboard shortcuts for frequently used operations.</dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Key bindings</dt>
  <dd>The <b>Window > Editors</b> preference page gives you the option to use 
  	non-standard <a href="../tasks/tkeybindings.htm">key bindings</a>.</dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Label decorations</dt>
  <dd>There is a new concept of <a href="../concepts/cdecorations.htm">label decorations</a>. 
  	Plug-ins may contribute information to resource labels and icons. You can 
  	select which decorations you would like to see on the 
  	<b>Workbench > Label Decorations</b> preference page.
  </dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>External tools</dt>
  <dd>You can now run arbitrary <a href="../concepts/cexttools.htm">external tools</a>
	from within Eclipse and display output from these tools in the log console view. 
	The Ant support makes use of this new feature as well.</dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Working sets</dt>
  <dd><a href="../concepts/cworkset.htm">Working sets</a> group elements for display in views or for operations on a set 
  	of elements. The Navigator view, Tasks view, the search facility and more 
  	support the use of working sets.  	
  </dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Perspectives</dt>
  <dd>You can no longer open more than one perspective of the same type in one
  	window. For example if you already have an open Resource perspective you will
  	have to open another window in order to open a second Resource perspective.
  	<P CLASS="Para">
  	The perspective preferences have changed as well and have been moved to
  	<b>Workbench > Perspectives</b>.
  	</P>  	
  </dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Fast views</dt>
  <dd><a href="../concepts/concepts-21.htm">Fast views</a> work like other views 
  	except they do not take up space in your Workbench window. They can easily 
  	be hidden and are accessed by toolbar buttons. Any view can be opened as a 
  	fast view.</dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Editors</dt>
  <dd>Editors are now shared by perspectives in the same window. For example if 
  	you open a set of files in the Resource perspective and then open a 
  	Java perspective, the same files will be visible in the Java perspective.
  	<P CLASS="Para">
  	You may specify the maximum number of open editors on the 
  	<b>Workbench > Editors</b> preference page. Old editors will be closed if
  	the limit is exceeded.
  	</P>  	
  </dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Text file encoding</dt>
  <dd>You can select the character encoding used to read and write files on
  	the <b>Workbench > Editors</b> preference page.</dd>
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
  <dt>Quick Fix</dt>
  <dd>Certain problems displayed in the tasks view may now be fixed <a href="../tasks/tquickfix.htm">automatically</a>,
  	with a click of the mouse.
  </dd>

  <a href="../concepts/concepts-17a.htm">local history</a> using the new
