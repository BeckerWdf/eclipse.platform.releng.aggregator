What's new in 2.0</H1>
<P CLASS="Para"> There are numerous new features and changes to existing features 
  in the new Eclipse Team and CVS support. The following lists some of them. </P>
<dl> 
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Project Sets</dt>
  <dd>Team provides the Project Sets facility that allows the exporting and sharing 
    of the current workspace setup with other users. Project sets are created 
    or loaded using<b> File &gt; Export...</b> and <b>File &gt; Import</b> respectively.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>CVS specific terms throughout</dt>
  <dd>The CVS support uses the same terminology as CVS. This means that the term 
    branch is used instead of stream, update and commit instead of catch-up and 
    release, and version tag instead of version.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Text/binary</dt>
  <dd>Team now provides a mechanism for identifying what file types are text (ASCII) 
    and binary. CVS uses this mechanism to properly flag the types of files committed 
    to the repository. File types can be added to the <b>Team &gt; File Content</b> 
    preference page. </dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>CVS Keyword substitution mode</dt>
  <dd>In addition to text/binary determination, CVS also allows the configuration 
    of the keyword substitution mode of each file. This is done using the<b> Team 
    &gt; Change ASCII/Binary Property</b> menu command on a project or resource 
    that is shared with CVS.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Ignored resources</dt>
  <dd>There have been several improvements related to ignoring resources. As in 
    1.0, global ignores can be defined on the <b>Team &gt; Ignored Resources</b> 
    preference page. In addition, tools integrated with Eclipse can now mark their 
    binary output as derived. CVS and other repository plugins can automatically 
    ignore these resources. CVS also provides menus in the Navigator and Synchronize 
    view for adding a resource to the .cvsignore file.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Adding resources to CVS control</dt>
  <dd>New resources must now be explicitly added to CVS control. This improves 
    the users ability to determine which resources should be under version control 
    and which ones should be ignored.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>CVS and file transfer compression</dt>
  <dd>CVS now supports the compression of file transmissions. This could potentially 
    improve operation times over slow network connections. The compression level 
    can be set on the <b>Team &gt; CVS</b> preference page.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Source based comparison filter in Synchronize view and Merge editor</dt>
  <dd>The capability to filter out resources whose CVS revision numbers differ 
    but whose contents are the same has been added to the Synchronize view, merge 
    editor and other CVS compare views.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Override and Update/Override and Commit</dt>
  <dd>In the Synchronize view, conflicts can only be updated or committed using 
    the override menu items. This provides a safer work flow as Update and Commit 
    only work on non-conflicting changes.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Mark as merged in sync view</dt>
  <dd>When resolving conflicts in the Synchronize view, files that have been 
    saved will remain in the view until they are marked as being merged using 
    the &quot;Mark as Merged&quot; menu item. This allows multiple edits to be 
    performed on conflicts.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>CVS Console view</dt>
  <dd>The CVS Console view contains the messages received from the server while 
    performing CVS commands.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Tag with Existing</dt>
  <dd>In the CVS Repositories view, CVS supports moving of existing tags from 
    one resource lineup to another.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Branch and version tag detection</dt>
  <dd>CVS provides a Configure tags facility for discovering what tags exist in 
    the CVS repository. This facility is available in the CVS Repositories view 
    and from the Replace with and Compare with Branch or Version dialogs.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>CVS Decorator configuration</dt>
  <dd>You can configure the CVS label and icon decorations using the <b>Team &gt; 
    CVS &gt; Label Decorations</b> preference page.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Clearer branch/merge workflow</dt>
  <dd>Branching and merging are now both performed on a project in the local workspace. 
    This simplifies the workflow from 1.0 which required the use of the Repositories 
    view. </dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Synchronize Outgoing changes</dt>
  <dd>For CVS, the <b>Team</b> menu contains the<b> Synchronize Outgoing Changes</b> 
    command which will synchronize only your outgoing changes. This reduces the 
    amount of network traffic.</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Mixing of tags below the project</dt>
  <dd>In 1.0, all resources in the project were shared with the same tag (branch 
    or HEAD). In 2.0, the tags within a project can be mixed (just as with the 
    CVS command line tool)</dd>
  <p></P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> 
  <dt>Tasks for new and deleted resources</dt>
  <dd>CVS creates tasks in the Tasks view for new resources that have not been 
    added to CVS control or ignored and for deleted resources. Appropriate Quick 
    Fix menu operations are available for these tasks. The tasks can also be disabled 
    in the <b>Team &gt; CVS</b> preference page.</dd>
