Builds</H1>
<p CLASS="Head">
A <i>build</i> is a process that derives new resources from existing ones, or
updates existing resources, or both.&nbsp;</p>
<p CLASS="Head">
In the Workbench,&nbsp;different <i>builders</i> are invoked for different types
of projects. For example, when a build is triggered for a Java project, a Java
builder converts each Java source file (.java files) into one or more executable class files
(.class files). Builders usually enforce the constraints of some
domain. For example, a Web link builder could update links to files
whose name/location changes.</p>

<p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">There are two kinds of builds:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">An <i>incremental build</i> leverages a
    previously built state and applies the transforms of the configured builders
    to the resources that have changed since the previous state was computed
    (that is, since the last build).</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">A full build (or <i>rebuild</i>) discards any
    previously built state and transforms all requested resources according to
    the domain rules of the configured builders. The first incremental build is
    equivalent to a full build as there is no previous state to work from.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full and incremental builds can be done over a specific set of projects or
the workspace as a whole.&nbsp;Specific files and folders cannot be built. There are two ways that builds can be performed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Automatic builds are performed as resources are saved. Automatic builds are always incremental and always operate
    over the 
entire workspace. You can configure your Workbench preferences (<b>Window
    &gt; Preferences &gt; Workbench</b>) to perform builds automatically on resource
    modification.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
Manual builds are initiated when you explicitly select a menu item or press the
equivalent shortcut key. Manual builds can be either full or incremental and can operate over collections of projects 
or the entire workspace.</li>
</ul>
