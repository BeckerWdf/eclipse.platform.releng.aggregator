Three-way comparisons </H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
Three-way comparisons show the differences between
three different resources in the workbench or three versions of a
resource.&nbsp;This feature is most useful when merging resources or when there
is a conflict during synchronization.&nbsp;Conflicts occur when two developers add a
version from the stream to the workbench, then each developer modifies it, then
one
developer attempts to release the resource after the other developer has already
released it.&nbsp; </P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
When this situation arises,
you can view the differences between three resource
versions: the resource in the workbench, the version of the resource that is
released in the stream, and the <i> common ancestor</i> from which the
two conflicting versions are based.&nbsp;&nbsp;(If a common ancestor cannot be
determined, for example because a resource with the same name and path was
created and released by two different developers, the comparison becomes a
two-way comparison.) </P>

Top pane compares project structure; second pane from top shows a source file; below that 2 other panes show 2 other source files. Discrepancies are highlighted." width="463" height="378"> </P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
The common ancestor is displayed in the top pane of the text compare pane.&nbsp;
The differences that you  see highlighted are what has  changed in the
workbench resource as compared to the common ancestor, and what has been changed
in the stream resource as compared to the common ancestor. The sections that differ in all three files are highlighted as differences.&nbsp;Conflicts are shown in red, incoming changes in gray, and outgoing changes in 
blue. </P>
