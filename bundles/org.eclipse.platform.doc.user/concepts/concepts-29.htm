<h1 class="Head"> Three-way comparisons </h1>
     
<p class="Para"> Three-way comparisons show the differences between three different 
  versions of a resource.&nbsp;This feature is most useful when merging resources 
  or when there is a conflict during synchronization.&nbsp;Conflicts occur when 
  two developers add a version from the same branch to their workbench, then each 
  developer modifies it, then one developer attempts to commit the resource after 
  the other developer has already committed it.&nbsp; </p>
     
<p class="Para"> When this situation arises, you can view the differences between 
  three resource versions: the resource in the workbench, the version of the resource 
  that is committed in the branch, and the <i> common ancestor</i> from which the 
  two conflicting versions are based.&nbsp;&nbsp;(If a common ancestor cannot 
  be determined, for example because a resource with the same name and path was 
  created and committed by two different developers, the comparison becomes a 
  two-way comparison.) </p>
<h1>Interpreting Compare Results</h1>
<p>The Synchronize view allows you to view the differences between two or three 
  files. If a common ancestor is available, the sync view performs a three-way 
  comparison. It is possible that a common ancestor for two conflicting resource 
  versions cannot be determined, (e.g. a resource with the same name and path 
  is created and committed by 2 different developers). In this case the compare 
  becomes a regular two-way compare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Para">In a three-way compare the workbench shows you: </p>
<ul class="UnorderedList">
  <li class="Item"> what has been changed in the first child in comparison to 
    the common ancestor&nbsp;</li>
  <li class="Item"> what has been changed in the second child in comparison to 
    the common ancestor.</li>
</ul>

 alt=" Picture of comparison editor. Top pane compares project structure; second pane from top shows a source file; below that 2 other panes show 2 other source files. Discrepancies are highlighted.">
   </p>
     
<p class="Para"> The common ancestor is displayed in the top pane of the text 
  compare pane (hidden in the above picture).&nbsp; The differences that you see 
  highlighted are what has changed in the workbench resource as compared to the 
  common ancestor, and what has been changed in the branch resource as compared 
  to the common ancestor. The sections that differ in all three files are highlighted 
  as differences.&nbsp;Conflicts are shown in red, incoming changes in gray, and 
  outgoing changes in blue. </p>
