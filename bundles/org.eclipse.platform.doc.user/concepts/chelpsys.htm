<h1>Help system</h1>

<p>The online help system lets you 
browse, search, and print system documentation. The documentation is organized into sets of 
information that are analogous to books. The help system also supplies a text
search engine for finding the information you need by keyword and
context-sensitive help for finding information to describe the particular
function you are working with.</p>

<h2>The help browser</h2>

<p>When you first open the help browser by selecting <b>Help &gt; Help Contents</b> 
in the Workbench, the first view shown is called Contents.  Contents displays 
various groupings of documentation for the product. Click on 
one of the links to expand the navigation tree for that set of documentation.
Browse the tree and click on topics to display them.</p>

<h2>Search</h2>
<p>If you want to find a particular piece of information in the online help, use
Search. The help system will search the entire information set, or only a part
of it, to find topics that meet the criteria you specify.</p>

<h2>Context-sensitive help</h2>

<p>If you are working through a task and encounter part of the interface that
you do not understand, use infopops. Bring focus to the interface widget in
question by clicking on it or using the Tab key, and then press <code>F1</code>
(<code>Ctrl+F1</code> on GTK+, and <code>Help</code> key on Carbon). The infopop
will provide you with information about the interface and, if appropriate, links
to more information.</p>
<p>Note: On the default install of KDE, Ctrl+F1 is the key binding for "Switch
to Desktop 1".  To make context-sensitive help work with GTK+ on KDE, then that
binding must be removed.  Try using the "KDE Default for 4 Modifier Keys" key
binding scheme.</p>
