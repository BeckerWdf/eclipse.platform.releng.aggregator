<h1>Help system</h1>

<p>
The help system lets you browse, search, bookmark, and print system documentation.
The documentation is organized into sets of information that are analogous to books.
The help system also supplies a text search capability for finding the information
you need by search phrase or keyword, and context-sensitive help for finding
information to describe the particular function you are working with.
</p>

<p>
You can interact with help system in the workbench using the Help view, or in the
separate Help window.
</p>

<h2>The Help view</h2>

<p>You can open a Help view by The Help view
  by selecting <b>Help &gt; Dynamic Help</b> or by selecting <b>Help &gt; Search </b>
in the Workbench., A help view will open turning to the Related Topics or to the
Search page. You can use links at the bottom of the help view to turn to other
pages. Browse topics and click on links to display them.</p>

</p>

<h2>The Help window</h2>

<p>
When you first open the Help window by selecting <b>Help &gt; Help Contents</b> 
in the workbench, the first view shown in the help window is called Contents.
Contents displays the table of contents for the product documentation. Click on 
one of the links to expand the navigation tree for a set of documentation.
Browse the tree and click on topics to display them.
</p>

<h2>Context-sensitive help</h2>

<p>
If you are working through a task and encounter a part of the interface that
you do not understand, you can summon context-sensitive help. Bring focus to the
interface part in question by clicking on it or using the Tab key, and then press
<code>F1</code> (<code>Shift+F1</code> on GTK+, and <code>Help</code> on the Mac).
</p>

<p>
A Help view (or tray if in a dialog) will display description of the part in
focus, and list related topics. You can leave the Help view open to see information
on other interface elements as you navigate to them.
</p>

<p>
If you request context help from inside a dialog, like a wizard or preferences, a
help tray similar to the Help view will appear inside the dialog. Dialogs also provide
an alternative means of requesting context help, via the help button in the button
bar:

</p>

<p>
An alternative way of presenting context-sensitive information is using
<b>infopops</b>. You can use

<a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.help.ui.browsersPreferencePage)")'>
<img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
<b>Help preference page</b>
</a>

to choose to use infopops instead of the Help view for displaying context-sensitive
help. If configured, a context help key, such as <code>F1</code>, will open an
infopop that will provide you with information about the interface and, if appropriate,
links to more information.
