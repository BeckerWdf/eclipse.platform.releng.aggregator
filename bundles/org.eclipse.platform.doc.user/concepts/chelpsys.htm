<h1>Online help system</h1>

<p>The online help system provides access to the documentation, and lets you 
browse, search, and print it. The documentation is organized into sets of 
information that are roughly analogous to books. These,
along with a full-text search engine and context-sensitive interface help, are
designed to help you find the information you need.</p>

<h2>The help browser</h2>

<p>When you first open the help browser by selecting <b>Help &gt; Help Contents</b> 
in the Workbench, the first view shown is called the Bookshelf. On the Bookshelf 
are links to the various groupings of documentation for the product. Click on 
one of the links to go to the navigation tree for that set of documentation. At 
any time, you can return to the bookshelf by clicking the <b>Table of Contents</b> 
button <img border="0" src="../images/bookshelf.gif" alt="Table of contents button">.</p>

<h2>Search</h2>
<p>If you want to find a particular piece of information in the online help, use
Search. The help system will search the entire information set, or only a part
of it, to find topics that meet the criteria you specify.</p>

<h2>Context-sensitive help</h2>

<p>If you are working through a task and encounter part of the interface that
you do not understand, use infopops. Bring focus to the interface widget in
question by clicking on it or using the Tab key, and then press F1. The infopop
will provide you with information about the interface and, if appropriate, links
to more information.</p>
