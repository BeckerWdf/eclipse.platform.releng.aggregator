<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type> Resources are versioned in order to capture a snapshot 
  of the current state of the resources at one specific point in time. Resources 
  in CVS are versioned by tagging them with a version label. When a resource is 
  versioned, it means that a non-modifiable copy of it can be retrieved from the 
  repository. </P>
<P CLASS="Intro">Versioning a project saves the line-up of all resource versions 
  in the project. Resources other than projects (that is, files and folders) can 
  be versioned.&nbsp; However, it is more common to version entire projects together 
  as the resources contained in a project are often highly interdependant. Projects 
  can be versioned from the workspace or from the branch in the CVS Repositories 
  view. The difference between these two approaches is in deciding which child 
  resource versions should be part of the project version. 
<P CLASS="Para"> When tagging a project as a version from the <i>workbench</i>, 
  the base revisions of the files in the workbench are tagged as belonging to 
  that version.&nbsp; This is the preferred method of versioning a project because 
  you know exactly which file revisions will be in the version.&nbsp;This operation 
  is allowed if you have outgoing changes or uncommitted changes. Uncommitted 
  changes are simply ignored and resources with outgoing changes can still have 
  their base revisions be part of the version.&nbsp; Versioning a project with 
  uncommitted or outgoing changes is handy if you have to split the project at 
  the point where you started making changes to the resources and commit the resources 
  to another branch.</P>
<P CLASS="Para"> When tagging a project as a version from a <i>branch</i> in the 
  CVS Repositories view, you are versioning whatever the latest resource versions 
  are in the branch at that moment in time.&nbsp; You should not version your 
  projects from the branch if you do not know what is committed in the branched. 
  For this reason, versioning from the workbench is often preferable.</P>
