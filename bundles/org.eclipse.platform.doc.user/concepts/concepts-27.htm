Resource versions</H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
Resources are versioned in order to capture a snapshot of the current state of 
the resources at one specific point in time.
When a resource is versioned, it means that a
non-modifiable copy of it is stored in a repository. </P>
<P CLASS="Intro">Resources other than projects (that is, files and
folders) cannot be explicitly versioned.&nbsp; However, these resources are 
versioned implicitly during synchronization as they are released to the stream. 
Streams contain the current version of a resource.
<P CLASS="Intro">Versioning a project saves the line-up of all resource versions in the project. The difference between versioning from the
workbench or from the
stream is in deciding which child resource versions should be part of the project version.
<P CLASS="Para">
When versioning a project from the <i>workbench</i>, the base versions of the resources in the
workbench are captured
as part of the project version.&nbsp; This is the preferred method of versioning a project because you know exactly
which resource versions will be in the project version.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This operation is allowed if you have outgoing changes or unreleased changes. Unreleased changes
are simply ignored and resources with outgoing changes can still have their base versions
be part of the project version.&nbsp; Versioning a project with unreleased or outgoing changes is
handy if you have to split the project at the point where you started making changes to the resources and release
the resources to another stream.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
When versioning from the <i>stream</i> you are versioning whatever the latest
resource versions are in the stream at that moment in time.&nbsp; You should not
version your projects from the stream if you do not know what is released in the stream. For this reason, versioning from the
workbench is often preferable.</P>


<P>In the Packages view of the Java perspective or in the Navigator view of the 
Resource perspective, you can enable the <b>Show Version Info </b>menu item to 
display the base version of each released file.</P>


<p>The local history of a resource is reset when you synchronize.&nbsp; A new 
history for that resource is created the first time you modify the base version 
of a resource.&nbsp; Projects do not have a local history.</p>
