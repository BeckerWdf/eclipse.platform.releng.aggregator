<h2>Capabilities</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">Capabilities are logical groups of related functionality that
  are used to perform a specific task, such development for a particular
  programming language. Welcome page selections 
  determine what capabilities are enabled, but capabilities can also later be enabled 
  or disabled using the preference page. When a capability is enabled, the actions 
  associated with that capability are available to you, however once a capability 
  is disabled those actions are no longer visible in menus, wizards and so on. 
  If you attempt to employ an action that has been disabled a prompt 
  will appear confirming the enablement of the action, thus providing new functions 
  to the Workbench as they are required. </P>
