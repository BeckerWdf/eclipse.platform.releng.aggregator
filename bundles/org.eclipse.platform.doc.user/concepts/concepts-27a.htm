<H1 CLASS="Head"> Ignoring Resources from Version Control</H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>Often a user may not want to commit all resources in 
  their project to the repository.&nbsp; For example, external editors may create 
  temporary files in your project,&nbsp;compilation of .java files creates .class 
  files, and likewise many build operations result in binary files. These files, 
  when taken together, may be quite large.&nbsp; In addition, they may be re-generated 
  whenever a build is performed, resulting in many&nbsp; outgoing changes. Typically 
  these are not files that one wants to share with other members of a team or 
  persist in the repository.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>Eclipse tools will mark there output as being &quot;derived&quot; 
  resources and repository providers that are integrated with the workbench, such 
  as CVS, will ignoe these resources. Eclipse also provides a Global Ignore mechanism 
  for specifying a set of file name patterns which identify resoures which are 
  to be ignored. Individual repository providers may also have their own mechanism 
  that work in conjunction with the global ignore list. For instance, CVS has 
  a facility which allows the user to specify file name patterns for resources 
  to be ignored in a special file named .cvsignore.</P>
