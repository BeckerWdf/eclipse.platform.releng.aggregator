Active Editors &amp; Views</H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
Open editors and views can be either active or inactive.&nbsp;
The active editor or view is the one whose editor tab is the same color as the
window title bar.&nbsp;The
workbench menubar and toolbar contain operations that are applicable to the
active editor.</P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
Any number of editors can be open at once, only one editor can be active at any one time.&nbsp;The
same is true for views.&nbsp; The choice of active editor determines the menu
and toolbar contributions.</P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
When multiple editors are open, they will appear stacked in the editor
area.&nbsp;You can change which editor is active by clicking on the
editor's tab.&nbsp; The name of the file being edited appears on the editor's tab.</P>
