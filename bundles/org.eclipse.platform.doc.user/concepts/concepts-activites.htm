<h2>Activities</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">Activities are plug-ins logically grouped to provide functionality 
  and improve scalability. Within the &quot;org.eclipse.activities&quot; extension 
  point, activities are declared in &quot;plugin.xml&quot; files.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">Using the activities editor, it is easy to generate definitions 
  as well as filter the activities that are required and hide those that are not 
  needed. The activities editor edits XML files with the predefined title &quot;activities.xml&quot;, 
  in which all the user specified definitions are generated. Activities can be 
  enabled or disabled using the preference page.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">The activities editor filters plug-ins, but not contributions. 
  It can also read &quot;activity requirement bindings&quot; on start up, however 
  does not generate them. </P>
<P CLASS="Para">The activities editor consists of three pages designed to assist 
  in the creation and organization of these activities. It provides a tree-like 
  representation of activities, and allows the visual addition and removal of 
  categories, activities, plug-ins and their bindings. </P>
