<h1>
External tools</h1>

<p CLASS="Para">External tools allow you to configure and run programs,
batch files, Ant build files, etc. using the Eclipse Workbench. You can
save these external tool configurations and run them at a later time.


<p CLASS="Para">You can add external tools as part of the build process
for a project. These external tools will run in the specified order every
time a project is built.

<p CLASS="Para">The following list of variables are available when you
configure external tools to run. These variables are automatically expanded
each time the external tool is run.
<blockquote>
<p CLASS="Para"><b>${workspace_loc}</b> - The absolute path on the system's
hard drive to the workspace.


<p CLASS="Para"><b>${workspace_loc:&lt;resource path>}</b> - The absolute
path on the system's hard drive to the specified resource. The &lt;resource
path> is the full path of the resource relative to the workspace root (for
example ${workspace_loc:/MyProject/MyFile.txt}).

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${project_loc}</b> - The absolute path on the system's
hard drive to the currently selected resource's project or the project
being built if the external tool is run as part of a build.

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${project_loc:&lt;resource path>}</b> - The absolute
path on the system's hard drive to the specified resource's project. The
&lt;resource path> is the full path of the resource relative to the workspace
root (for example ${workspace_loc:/MyProject/MyFile.txt}).

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${container_loc}</b> - The absolute path on the system's
hard drive to the currently selected resource's parent (either a folder
or project).

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${container_loc:&lt;resource path>}</b> - The absolute
path on the system's hard drive to the specified resource's parent (either
a folder or project). The &lt;resource path> is the full path of the resource
relative to the workspace root (for example ${workspace_loc:/MyProject/MyFile.txt}).

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${resource_loc}</b> - The absolute path on the system's
hard drive to the currently selected resource.

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${resource_loc:&lt;resource path>}</b> - The absolute
path on the system's hard drive to the specified resource. The &lt;resource
path> is the full path of the resource relative to the workspace root (for
example ${workspace_loc:/MyProject/MyFile.txt}).

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${project_path}</b> - The full path relative to the
workspace of the currently selected resource's project or of the project
being built if the external tool is run as part of a build.

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${container_path}</b> - The full path relative to the
workspace of the currently selected resource's parent (either a folder
or project).

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${resource_path}</b> - The full path relative to the
workspace of the currently selected resource.

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${project_name}</b> - The name of the currently selected
resource's project or of the project being built if the external tool is
run as part of a build.

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${container_name}</b> - The name of the currently selected
resource's parent (either a folder or project).

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${resource_name}</b> - The name of the currently selected
resource.

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${build_type}</b> - The kind of build when the external
tool is run as part of a build. The value can be one of "full", "incremental",
or "auto". If the external tool is run outside of a build, the value is
then "none".

<p CLASS="Para"><b>${ant_target:&lt;target name>}</b> - The name of a target
in an Ant build file to perform.</blockquote>

<h2>
Log Console view</h2>
The Log Console view shows the output from a running external tool. From
the preferences dialog box, you can change the default settings for the
Log Console view using the External Tools preference page.
