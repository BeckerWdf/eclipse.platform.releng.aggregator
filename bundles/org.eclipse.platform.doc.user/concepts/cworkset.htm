Working sets</H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
Working sets group elements for display in views or for operations on a set 
of elements. </P>

<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
The navigator view uses working sets to restrict the set of resources that are 
displayed. If a working set is selected in the navigator, only resources, 
children of resources, and parents of resources contained in the working set are 
shown. </P>

<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
Working sets may be used in the task view to limit the display of tasks in a 
similar fashion as the navigator view. </P>

<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
When using the Workbench search facility, working sets may be used to restrict 
the set of elements that are searched. </P>

<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
Different views provide different means to specify a working set. However, they 
typically use the following working set selection dialog to manage existing working 
sets and to create new working sets.
</P>

<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
When you create a new working set you may be able to choose from different types
of working sets. In the example below you can create a resource working set, a
Java working set or a help working set.

<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
If you create a new resource working set you will be able to select the working 
set resources as shown below. The same wizard is used to edit an existing working
set. Different types of working sets provide different kinds of working set 
editing wizards.

<DIV CLASS="Note">
  <P CLASS="Para" Label=Type> <strong>Note:</strong> Newly created resources are 
    not automatically included in the active working set. They are implicitly 
    included in a working set if they are children of an existing working set 
    element. If you want to include other resources after you have created them 
    you have to explicitly add them to the working set. </P>
