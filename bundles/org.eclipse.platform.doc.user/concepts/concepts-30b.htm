Synchronize view</H1>
<P>
This view allows you to catch up resources in the workbench and release resources
from the workbench to a stream.&nbsp;Here is what the Synchronize view looks like:</P>
<P>
<img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image245_sync_view.jpg" alt=" Picture of 3-paned editor. Top pane compares project structure; bottom 2 panes (side by side) compare lines of source." ></P>
<h2>
Modes</h2>
<P>
There are three different viewing modes (filters) that you can use in this view to make
the synchronization process easier:</P>
<dl>
  <dt>Catch Up</dt>
  <dd>In this mode, only resources which have versions
more recent than the base version of resources in the workbench (incoming
changes) are visible. If you have incoming changes when you synchronize, you
    will start
off in this mode.</dd>
  <dt>Release</dt>
  <dd> In this mode, only resources which have been modified in the
workbench (outgoing changes) are visible.&nbsp;If you do not have incoming
    changes when you synchronize, you will start in this mode.</dd>
  <dt>Catch Up/Release</dt>
  <dd> In this mode both incoming and outgoing changes are shown, and you can
    both catch up and release. You will remain in this mode with future synchronizations until you
close the view.&nbsp; The advantage to using this dual mode is you can do either
task as you choose. The disadvantage is that performing a simultaneous
    bidirectional merge is often complicated. In addition, you risk accidentally
releasing a conflict when you meant to catch up to it. You can choose to always use Catch Up/Release mode on the
workbench preferences page (<b>Workbench &gt; Preferences &gt; Team</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<P>
Modes not only filter the set of visible changes but also restrict the set of operations
available. They support and encourage the ideal
    work flow. You can switch modes using the toolbar of the Synchronization
view.&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<b>Important</b>: It is preferable to catch up resources in the workbench first, resolve any
conflicts that exist by merging, then release workbench resources to the stream.</P>
<P>
Regardless of the mode that you select, you will always see any conflicts that
exist. You can filter out other outgoing and incoming changes by clicking the <b> Show Only Conflicts</b>
button.</P>

<h2>
Structure Compare Pane</h2>
<P>
This pane allows you to view a hierarchy tree of all
the resource differences between the stream and the workbench.</P>

<h2>
Text Compare Pane</h2>
<P>
This pane allows you to view the content differences
of the resource selected in the structure compare pane.
You can choose to ignore whitespace differences from the view's drop-down menu.</P>
