CVS Synchronize view</H1>
<P> This view allows you to update resources in the workbench and commit resources 
  from the workbench to a branch.&nbsp;Here is what the Synchronize view looks 
  like:</P>
<P>
<img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image245_sync_view.jpg" alt=" Picture of 3-paned editor. Top pane compares project structure; bottom 2 panes (side by side) compare lines of source." ></P>
<h2>
Modes</h2>
<P>
There are three different viewing modes (filters) that you can use in this view to make
the synchronization process easier:</P>
<dl> 
  <dt>Incoming</dt>
  <dd>In this mode, only resources which have been changed in the repository since 
    they were last loaded or synchronized with those in the workbench (incoming 
    changes) are visible. If you have incoming changes when you synchronize, you 
    will start off in this mode.</dd>
  <dt>Outgoing</dt>
  <dd> In this mode, only resources which have been modified in the workbench 
    (outgoing changes) are visible.&nbsp;If you do not have incoming changes when 
    you synchronize, you will start in this mode.</dd>
  <dt>Incoming/Outgoing</dt>
  <dd> In this mode both incoming and outgoing changes are shown, and you can 
    both update and commit. You will remain in this mode with future synchronizations 
    until you close the view.&nbsp; The advantage to using this dual mode is you 
    can do either task as you choose. The disadvantage is that performing a simultaneous
    bi-directional merge is often complicated. In addition, you risk accidentally
    committing a conflict when you meant to update to it. You can choose to always 
    use Incoming/Outgoing mode on the workbench preferences page (<b>Window&gt; 
    Preferences &gt; CVS</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<P>
Modes not only filter the set of visible changes but also restrict the set of operations
available. They support and encourage the ideal
    work flow. You can switch modes using the toolbar of the Synchronization
view.&nbsp;</P>
<P> <b>Important</b>: It is preferable to update resources in the workbench first, 
  resolve any conflicts that exist by merging, then commit workbench resources 
  to the repository.</P>
<P>
Regardless of the mode that you select, you will always see any conflicts that
exist. You can filter out other outgoing and incoming changes by clicking the <b> Show Only Conflicts</b>
button.</P>

<h2>
Structure Compare Pane</h2>
<P> This pane allows you to view a hierarchy tree of all the resource differences 
  between the repository and the workbench.</P>

<h2>
Text Compare Pane</h2>
<P>
This pane allows you to view the content differences
of the resource selected in the structure compare pane.
You can choose to ignore whitespace differences from the view's drop-down menu.</P>
