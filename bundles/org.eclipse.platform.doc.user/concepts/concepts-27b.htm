<H1>Streams</H1>

<p>Teams share and integrate their ongoing work in <i>streams</i>.&nbsp;Think of a stream as a shared work area that can be updated
at any time by team members.&nbsp; In this way, individuals can work on a team
project, share their work with others on the team, and access the work of others
during all stages of the project.&nbsp; The stream effectively represents the
current shared state of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Resources can be changed in the workbench without affecting the
stream.&nbsp; Individuals must explicitly provide their changed resources to the
stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Every repository has at least one stream.&nbsp; Under certain
conditions, more than one stream may exist in a repository.&nbsp; For
example, one stream may be for ongoing work, and another stream may be for maintenance
work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>As you make changes locally in your workbench, you are working
isolated from the rest of the team. When you are ready to make your local
resource changes available to other team members, you'll need to <i> release</i> your
work to the stream. All such changes are termed as outgoing changes when you do
a synchronization.
</p>
  <p>Ideally, you should catch
  up to a stream before releasing to it. This ensures that you have the very
  latest work from the other team members. After you have caught up with the
  stream, merged any conflicting changes in your local workbench, and tested
  your changes locally, you can more easily release your workbench's changes to
  the stream.</p>

  <p>When you release changes to the stream, your changes are
  copied from your local workbench to the stream. As a result, these changes are
  then seen as incoming changes when other developers catch up to the stream
  later.</p>
