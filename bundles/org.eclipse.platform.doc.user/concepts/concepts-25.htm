Features</H1>

<p>On disk, an Eclipse-based product is structured as a collection of <b>plug-ins</b>.
Each plug-in contains the code that provides some of the product's
functionality. The code and other files for a plug-in are installed on the local
computer, and get activated automatically as required. A product's plug-ins are
grouped together into features. A <b>feature</b> is the smallest unit of separately downloadable and installable
functionality. (The notion of a feature is new for Eclipse 2.0; it replaces the similar
notion of component in Eclipse 1.0.) </p>
<p>The fundamentally modular nature of the Eclipse platform makes it easy for
the user to install additional features and plug-ins into an Eclipse-based
product, and to update the product's existing features and plug-ins. The user
can do either using traditional native installers running separate from Eclipse,
or using the Eclipse platform's own update manager. The Eclipse <b>update
manager</b> can be used to discover, download, and install updated features and
plug-ins from special web-based Eclipse update sites.</p>
<p>The basic underlying mechanism is simple enough: the files for a feature or
plug-in are always stored in a subdirectory whose name includes a version
identifier (e.g., &quot;2.0.0&quot;); different versions of a feature or plug-in
are always given different version identifiers, thereby ensuring that the
multiple versions of the same feature or plug-in can co-exist side by side on
disk. This means that installing or updating features and plug-ins requires
adding more files, but never requires deleting or overwriting existing files.
Once the files are installed on the local computer, the new feature and plug-in
versions are available to be configured. The same installed base of files is
therefore capable of supporting many different <b>configurations</b>
simultaneously; installing and upgrading an existing product are reduced to
formulating a configuration incrementally better than the current one. Important
configurations can be saved for posterity, and restored to active service in the
event of an unsuccessful upgrade.</p>

<p>The <b>About</b> item on the <b>Help</b> menu provides information about installed features and plug-ins. 
The <b>Software Updates</b> submenu on the <b>Help</b> menu groups together items for updating existing features, and 
for finding, downloading, and installing new features.
