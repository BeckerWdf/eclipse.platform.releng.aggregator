<h1 class="Head"> Synchronizing with a CVS repository</h1>
   
<p class="Para"> In the CVS team programming environment, there are    two
distinct processes involved in synchronizing resources: <i>updating</i> 
   with the latest changes from a branch and <i>committing</i> to the branch.&nbsp;</p>
   
<p class="Para">When you make changes in the Workbench, the resources   
are saved locally.&nbsp; Eventually you will want to commit your changes
to the branch so others can have access to them.&nbsp; Meanwhile, others
may have committed changes to the branch.&nbsp; You will want to update
your Workbench resources with their changes.</p>
   
<p class="Para"><b>Important</b>: It is preferable to update <i> before</i>
    committing, in case there are conflicts with the resources in your Workbench
   and the resources currently in the branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   
<p>When you select <b>Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</b> for a resource, 
   the Synchronize view opens. You can set filters to control whether you 
want    to view only i<i>ncoming changes</i> or <i>outgoing changes</i>. Incoming
changes    come from the branch; if accepted, they will update the Workbench
resource to    the latest version currently committed into the branch. Outgoing
changes come    from the Workbench; if committed, they will change the branch
resources to match    those currently present in the Workbench. </p>
     
<p>Regardless of which mode (filter) you select, the Synchronize view always 
shows    you conflicts that arise when you have locally modified a resource 
for which    a more recent version is available in the branch.&nbsp; In this 
situation you    can choose to do one of three things: update the resource 
from the branch, commit    your version of the resource to the branch , or 
merge your work with the changes    in the branch resource.&nbsp; Typically 
you will want to merge, as the other    two options will result in loss of 
work. </p>
