Team synchronization</H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>
In the team programming environment, there are two distinct processes involved in
synchronizing resources: <i>catching up</i> with the stream and <i>releasing</i>
to the stream.&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>When you make changes in the workbench, the resources are
saved locally.&nbsp; Eventually you will want to release your changes to
the stream so others can have access to them.&nbsp; Meanwhile, others may have
released changes to the steam.&nbsp; You will want to catch up by updating your
workbench resources with their changes.</P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type><b>Important</b>: It is preferable to catch up <i> before</i> releasing, in case there
are conflicts&nbsp; with the resources in your workbench and
the resources currently in the stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>When you select <b>Team &gt; Synchronize with Stream</b> for a resource, the
Synchronize view opens. You can set filters to control whether you want to
view only i<i>ncoming changes</i> or <i>outgoing changes</i>. Incoming changes come from the
stream; if accepted, they will update the workbench resource to the latest version
currently released into the stream. Outgoing changes come from the workbench; if
released, they will update the stream resources to the version currently
present in the workbench.
</P>


<P>Regardless of which mode (filter) you select, the Synchronize view always
shows you conflicts that arise when you have locally modified a resource for which a more
recent version is available in the stream.&nbsp; In this situation you can
choose to do one of three things: catch up the resource from the stream, release
your version of the resource to the stream , or merge your work and the stream
resource.&nbsp; Typically you will want to merge, as the other two options will
result in loss of work.
