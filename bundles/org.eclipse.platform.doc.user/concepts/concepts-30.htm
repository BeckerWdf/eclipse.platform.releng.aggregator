<H1 CLASS="Head"> Synchronizing with a CVS repository</H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type> In the CVS team programming environment, there are 
  two distinct processes involved in synchronizing resources: <i>updating</i> 
  with the latest changes from a branch and <i>committing</i> to the branch.&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>When you make changes in the workbench, the resources 
  are saved locally.&nbsp; Eventually you will want to commit your changes to 
  the branch so others can have access to them.&nbsp; Meanwhile, others may have 
  committed changes to the branch.&nbsp; You will want to update your workbench 
  resources with their changes.</P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type><b>Important</b>: It is preferable to update <i> before</i> 
  committing, in case there are conflicts with the resources in your workbench 
  and the resources currently in the branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>When you select <b>Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</b> for a resource, 
  the Synchronize view opens. You can set filters to control whether you want 
  to view only i<i>ncoming changes</i> or <i>outgoing changes</i>. Incoming changes 
  come from the branch; if accepted, they will update the workbench resource to 
  the latest version currently committed into the branch. Outgoing changes come 
  from the workbench; if committed, they will change the branch resources to match 
  those currently present in the workbench. </P>


<P>Regardless of which mode (filter) you select, the Synchronize view always shows 
  you conflicts that arise when you have locally modified a resource for which 
  a more recent version is available in the branch.&nbsp; In this situation you 
  can choose to do one of three things: update the resource from the branch, commit 
  your version of the resource to the branch , or merge your work with the changes 
  in the branch resource.&nbsp; Typically you will want to merge, as the other 
  two options will result in loss of work. </P>
