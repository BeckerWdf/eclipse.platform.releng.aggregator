<h3>Running Ant buildfiles</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para">Any file with a .xml extension can be run as an Ant buildfile. 
  Of course, not all such files really are Ant buildfiles, but no harm is done 
  if an attempt is made to mistakenly run a non-Ant .xml file as an Ant buildfile.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">In this section, the basic mechanisms for running Ant buildfiles 
  in Eclipse will be covered, using the HelloWorld.xml file created in the last 
  section.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Select HelloWorld.xml in the Navigator and choose <b>Run &gt; External Tools 
    </b> from its context menu.</li>
  <li>The <strong>External Tools </strong>dialog appears. 
    <p><img src="../images/Image603_run_dialog.gif" alt="Run Ant dialog" border="0" width="799" height="544"></p>
  </li>
  <li>This dialog allows the configuration of the many aspects of the way an Ant 
    buildfile is run, but for now concentrate on the <b>Targets</b> tab which 
    allows the selection of which Ant targets to run and their order. Select both 
    targets and leave the order as the default. </li>
  <li>Click <b>Run</b>.</li>
  <li>The Ant buildfile is run, and the output is sent to the Console view.</li>
</ol>
<p>Fortunately, if the buildfile is run so that the Hello target is executed first 
  and other times so that the World target is first, the dialog does not need 
  to be brought up each time nor does the ordering need to be changed.</p>
