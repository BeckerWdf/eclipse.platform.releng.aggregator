<h3>Running Ant scripts</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para">Any file with a .xml extension can be run as an Ant script. Of 
  course, not all such files really are Ant scripts, but no harm is done if you 
  mistakenly attempt to run a non-Ant .xml file as an Ant script.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">In this section, we will cover the basic mechanisms for running 
  Ant scripts in Eclipse, using the HelloWorld.xml file created in the last section.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Select HelloWorld.xml in the Navigator and choose 'Run Ant...' from its 
    context menu.</li>
  <li>The Run Ant dialog appears.<img src="../images/Image603_run_dialog.jpg" width="592" height="604"><br>
  </li>
  <li>This dialog allows you to configure many aspects of the way your Ant script 
    is run, but for now we will concentrate on the Targets tab which allows you 
    to select the Ant targets to run and their order. Select both targets and 
    leave the order as the default. </li>
  <li>Click Run.</li>
  <li>The Ant script is run, and the output is sent to the Console view.</li>
</ol>
<p>But what if you sometimes want to run the script so the Hello target executed 
  first, and other times so the World target was first? Would you have to bring 
  up the dialog each time and change the ordering? Fortunately, as we'll see in 
  the next section, the answer is no.</p>
