Removing bookmarks</h3>
<p CLASS="Head">In this section we will learn how to remove the bookmarks we
have created.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<P CLASS="Para">
In the Bookmarks view, select JanesFile.txt (the second bookmark we created) and do one of the following:</P>
<ul>
  <li>
    Click the Delete button <img src="../images/Image54_bookmark_del1.gif" alt="Bookmark delete button" border="0" width="27" height="22">
    on the view's toolbar.
  </li>
  <li>
    From the bookmark's context menu choose delete.</li>
  <li>
    Hit the Delete key on your keyboard.</li>
  
</ul>
<P CLASS="Para">
Notice that the bookmark is removed from the Bookmarks view.</P>
<blockquote>
<P CLASS="Para">
<img src="../images/Image54_bookmark_oneleft.gif" alt="Bookmark view" border="0" width="309" height="152"></P>
</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>We should have one remaining bookmark. This bookmark is associated with a 
  line in the file JanesFile.txt. There are two other approaches to removing 
  this bookmark. 
  <ul>
  <li>Use <b>Remove Bookmark</b> in the marker bar of the JanesFile.txt editor. You may 
  recall that we used <b>Add Bookmark</b> in the marker bar when we first created the 
  bookmark.<br>
    <img src="../images/Image54_bookmark_remove2.gif" alt="Bookmark menu" border="0" width="267" height="154"></li>
  <li>Delete the bookmark (as we did above) by using <b>Delete</b> from the bookmark's
    popup menu in the Bookmarks view.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Let's go with the second approach.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<P CLASS="Para">Ensure there is an editor open on JanesFile.txt.&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para">Although we don't actually need to open the editor, doing so
will allow us to watch the editor update as we delete the bookmark.</P>
  </li>
  <li>
<p CLASS="Head">In the Bookmarks view, select JanesFile.txt (the remaining
bookmark). Click the Delete button <img src="../images/Image54_bookmark_del1.gif" alt="Bookmark delete button" border="0" width="27" height="22">
    on the view's toolbar.
Notice that the bookmark is removed from the Bookmarks view and the
JanesFile.txt editor.&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
</ol>
