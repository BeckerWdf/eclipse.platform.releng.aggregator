<h3>Building a .jar file for the plug-in</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para">Now we are ready to use the build.xml Ant buildfile that was created 
  in the last section:</P>
<ol>
  <li>Select the build.xml file in the Navigator and choose <b>Run &gt; External 
    Tools </b> from the context menu.</li>
  <li>In the dialog, the Targets tab should be visible. Make sure that 'build.jars' 
    is the only item in the list selected.</li>
  <li>Switch to the <b>Refresh</b> tab. The options on this tab control if and 
    how the workspace looks for new, changed and deleted resources after the buildfile 
    finishes execution. Because refreshing can be an expensive operation, you 
    should refresh the smallest subset of the workspace necessary for your buildfile.</li>
  <li>Check <b>Refresh resources upon completion</b>, then select <b>The project 
    containing the selected resource</b>.<br>

  </li>
  <li>Click <b>Run</b>.</li>
  <li>The Ant buildfile runs, executing the build.jars target. Output from the 
    buildfile is visible in the Console view.</li>
  <li>When the buildfile finishes, notice that there is a new .jar file under 
    your project containing the two class files that comprise your plug-in. If 
    we had chosen not to refresh the project, the .jar file would still have been 
    created, but we would not see it in the Navigator.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've run the default target for the build.xml Ant buildfile, but there are many 
  other targets and options to be explored.</p>
