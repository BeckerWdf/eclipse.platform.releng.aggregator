<h3>Working With CVS History</h3>
<p class="Head">Projects that are managed by CVS now have local history and remote history managed from the same location. You can open, compare,
and replace file remote and local revisions from the History View.</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p class="Head"> In one of the navigation views select the any file that is part of a CVS managed project.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p class="Para"> From the file's context menu, select one of the following options:
     <br><br><b>Team&gt;Show History....<br>
     Compare With&gt;History....<br>
     Replace With&gt;History....<br>
      </b><br>
      Note that all of these actions basically have the same end result: the opening of the History View
      with the revisions of the seleted file displayed in the table. The only difference between the three
      actions is that some actions open the History View in a different modes. For more info see
       <a href="../reference/ref-32a.htm">CVS History View</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p class="Para"> The history view will open and display the revisions available for the 
     selected file. You can control what type of revisions are shown in the table by selecting
     the appropriate toggle button in the History View tooblar. The options are: <b>Local and Remote
     Revisions, Local Revisions, Remote Revisions</b>.

     <br><b>Open</b>: opens the selected revision

      the current revision of the file that resides in the workspace
      <br><b>Compare with Each Other</b>: to compare two selected revisions
      <br><b>Get Contents</b>: replaces the current workspace file with the contents 
      of the selected revision.
