  On some platforms, for example on the Macintosh and Microsoft Windows,
  the operating system's file system browser can be used to copy folders and files 
  from the file system into the Workbench.</P>
<P CLASS="Para"> <strong>Note: </strong>The resource(s) must be dragged to the 
  exact location in the Navigator view hierarchy where the resources are to reside; 
  they cannot be simply dragged and dropped onto a blank area in the Navigator 
  view.</P>
<ol>
  <li>
    <P CLASS="Para"> Open the operating system's file system explorer.</P>
  </li>
  <li>
    <P CLASS="Para"> Locate the file JanesFile.txt that was recently exported 
      and drag it to a specific location in the Navigator view in the Workbench.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
    <P CLASS="Para">When dragging resources into the Navigator, the project/folder 
      that the resource is being dropped into will be selected.</P>
