<h1>Executing project builders</h1>
  
<P CLASS="Para">The whole point of project builders is that you don't need to 
explicitly tell them to run.  Instead, they run automatically whenever a qualifying build takes place 
  for the project that owns the buildfile. Remember that the builders are triggered as indicated
  on the <strong>Build Options</strong> tab in the <b>External Tools</b> dialog and can be 
  any combination of after a clean, during a manual build or during auto builds. Let's see how this works.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Select the <code>HW</code> project in one of the navigation views. In the workbench menu 
    bar, choose <b>Project &gt; Clean...</b> Select <b>Clean selected projects</b> 
    and click <b>Ok</b></li>
  <li>The project is rebuilt and the <code>projectBuilder.xml</code> buildfile is run. Notice 
    the output from this buildfile in the <b><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/console/ref-console_view.htm">Console view</a></b>. </li>
  <li>Make sure the Autobuild preference is turned on, then make some trivial 
    change to <code>HelloWorld.java</code> and save the change. The save triggers an auto build, 
    but the auto build does not trigger the project builder. </li>
  <li>Suppose we don't want to see the buildfile output every time it runs. Go 
    back to the <b>External Tools Builders</b> page of the project properties dialog 
    on <code>HW</code>. Select the <code>Makejar</code> entry and click <b>Edit...</b>. On the <b>Main</b> 
    tab, uncheck the <b>Capture Output</b> option, apply the change and exit back 
    to the workbench. </li>
</ol>
<P CLASS="Para">This concludes our look at Ant buildfiles as project builders 
  in Eclipse. It's worth repeating that though this example used a Java project, 
  project builders are not tied to Java, and may be used for <a href="qs-96_non_ant_pjs.htm">any type of project</a>.
