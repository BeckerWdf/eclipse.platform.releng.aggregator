  <h1 class="Head">Team CVS tutorial</h1>
  <p>This chapter will explain how to use the CVS team capabilities built into the Workbench. The steps in this chapter
  are team oriented; it will be difficult to complete these tutorials if others are not simultaneously working through
  this chapter.</p>
  <p>You will learn how to work on a project and then commit changes to the repository for others on the team to use.
  By continuing to work on the project alongside other users, this section will demonstrate how to commit resources
  that other users may be simultaneously working on, and how to update a workspace with changes others make in the
  project.</p>
  <p>Remember, before getting started, that you need to entice at least one co-worker into working through these steps
  as well. Another option is to start up two Eclipse instances at once and step through both roles yourself.</p>
