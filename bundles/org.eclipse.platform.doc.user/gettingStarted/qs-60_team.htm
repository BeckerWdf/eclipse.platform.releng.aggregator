<H1 CLASS="Head"> Team CVS tutorial</H1>
<P>In this chapter, we will learn to use the CVS team capabilities built into 
  the Workbench. The steps in this chapter are team oriented; it will be difficult to complete these tutorials if others are not simultaneously working through this 
  chapter. </P>


<P>We will learn how to work on our project, then commit changes to the repository 
  for others on the team to use. As we continue to work on the project alongside 
  other users we will see how to commit resources that other users may be simultaneously 
  working on, and how to update our workspace with changes others make in the 
  project. </P>


<P>Remember, before we get started you need to entice at least one coworker into
working through these steps with you.
