<h3>Saving &amp; Reusing Ant options</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para">When we ran the HelloWorld.xml Ant buildfile in the last section, 
  the choice of targets, along with all other options in the Run Ant dialog were 
  saved in an entity called a 'launch configuration'. Launch configurations contain 
  all details necessary to run an Ant buildfile in a particular way. It is 
  perfectly valid to have multiple launch configurations associated with a single 
  Ant buildfile. Therefore, in addition to the launch configuration that was created in 
  the last step, specifying that our HelloWorld.xml buildfile should execute the 
  targets &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;World&quot; in that order, a second launch configuration could be created
  for the same buildfile specifying different targets or just different ordering.
  Creating multiple launch configurations in this manner allows you to quickly run 
  your Ant buildfile in any configuration by simply specifying the corresponding 
  launch configuration.</P>
<ol>
  <li>From the Workbench toolbar, select <b>Run &gt; External Tools &gt; Open External Tools Dialog...</b>.</li>
  <li>The External Tools dialog opens and presents a choice of launch configurations 
    to view and edit. The launch configuration we created when we ran the HelloWorld.xml 
    buildfile is selected in the tree at the left, and the tabs on the right show 
    the options for this launch configuration.<br>
    <img src="../images/et_dialog.png" alt="External tools dialog" border="0" > 
  </li>
  <li>At the top of the dialog, change the Name to 'Hello World' and <b>Apply</b> 
    the change.</li>
  <li>In the tree at left, bring up on the context menu on the selected launch 
    configuration and choose <b>Duplicate</b>, or select the <b>Duplicate</b> on the 
    toolbar above the tree. A copy of the launch configuration 
    for the Hello World buildfile is created, '(1)' is appended to the name, and 
    the new launch configuration is selected in the tree.</li>
  <li>Rename the new configuration to 'World Hello'.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Targets</b> tab, click the <b>Order...</b> button, change the 
    order of the targets so that the World target executes first, and <b>Apply</b> 
    the change.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Run</b>.</li>
  <li>As before, the HelloWorld.xml buildfile runs and sends its output to the 
    Console view. This time however, because the targets were reversed, the output 
    is reversed as well.</li>
  <li>Go back to the External Tools drop down in the toolbar. <br>
    <img src="../images/et_dropdown.png" alt="External tools drop-down menu" border="0" ><br>
    Notice now that there are two entries in the history, one for Hello World 
    and one for World Hello. In order to rerun the Ant buildfile so that it outputs 
    Hello World, just select this launch configuration in the history. To rerun 
    the launch configuration that outputs World Hello, select this configuration 
    in the history.<br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: The history is ordered so that the most frequently 
    run configurations are at the top of the dropdown.</li>
