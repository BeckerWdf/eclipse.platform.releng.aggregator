<h3>Saving &amp; Reusing Ant options</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para">When we ran the HelloWorld.xml Ant buildfile in the last section, 
  the choice of targets, along with all other options in the Run Ant dialog were 
  saved in an entity called a 'launch configuration'. Launch configurations contain 
  all details necessary to run a single Ant buildfile in a particular way. It is 
  perfectly valid to have multiple launch configurations associated with a single 
  Ant buildfile. So, in addition to the launch configuration that was created in 
  the last step, specifying that our HelloWorld.xml buildfile should execute the 
  targets Hello &amp; World in that order, we could create a second launch configuration 
  for this same buildfile specifying the same targets but in the reverse order. So 
  far so good. But the really nice thing about launch configurations is that now 
  you can quickly run your Ant buildfile in either configuration by simply specifying 
  the corresponding launch configuration.</P>
<ol>
  <li>From the External Tools drop down on the Workbench toolbar, select 'External 
    Tools...'.</li>
  <li>The External Tools dialog opens. This should look a lot like the Run Ant 
    dialog we saw previously. In fact, it's identical except that in the External 
    Tools dialog, you have a choice of which launch configuration you wish to 
    view and edit. The launch configuration we created when we ran the build.xml 
    buildfile is selected in the tree at the left, and the tabs on the right show 
    the options for this launch configuration.<br>

  <li>At the top of the dialog, change the Name to 'Hello World' and Apply the 
    change.</li>
  <li>In the tree at left, bring up on the context menu on the selected launch 
    configuration and choose 'Duplicate'. A copy of the launch configuration for 
    the Hello World buildfile is created, '(1)' is appended to the name, and the 
    new launch configuration is selected in the tree.</li>
  <li>Rename the new configuration to 'World Hello'.</li>
  <li>In the Targets tab, click the 'Order...' button, change the order of the 
    targets so that the World target executes first, and Apply the change.</li>
  <li>Click Run.</li>
  <li>As before, the HelloWorld.xml buildfile runs and sends its output to the Console 
    view. This time however, because the targets were reversed, the output is 
    reversed as well.</li>
  <li>Go back to the External Tools drop down in the toolbar. <br>

    Notice now that there are two entries in the history, one for Hello World 
    and one for World Hello. In order to rerun the Ant buildfile so that it outputs 
    Hello World, just select this launch configuration in the history. To rerun 
    the launch configuration that outputs World Hello, select this configuration 
    in the history. Note that the history is ordered so that the most frequently 
    run configurations are at the top of the dropdown.</li>
</ol>
<p>This concludes our quick look at the basics of Ant integration in Eclipse. 
  In the next chapters, we consider several real-world use cases for running Ant 
  buildfiles inside Eclipse.</p>
