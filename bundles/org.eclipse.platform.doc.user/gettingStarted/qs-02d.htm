<h3>
Editors</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">
 Depending on the type of file you are editing, the appropriate editor is
displayed in the editor area. For example, if you are editing a .TXT file, a text editor is displayed in the editor area.
The figure below shows an editor open on the file <i>sample.txt</i>.&nbsp; The
name of the file appears in the tab of the editor. If an asterisk (*) appears at
the left side of the tab this indicates that the editor has unsaved changes. If
you attempt to close the editor or exit the Workbench with unsaved changes you
will be prompted to save your editor's changes.</P>

</P>


<p class="Para">When an editor is active the Workbench menu bar and toolbar contain 
  operations applicable to the editor. When a view becomes active, the editor 
  operations are disabled. However, certain operations may be appropriate 
  in the context of a view and will remain enabled.</p>


<P CLASS="Para">
You can stack editors in the editor area and activate individual editors by clicking the tab for the
editor. You can also tile editors side-by-side in the editor area so their
content can be viewed simultaneously.
In the figure below editors for sample.txt and otherFile.txt have been placed
one above the other. We will discuss how you can rearrange views and editors 
later in this tutorial.</P>

</P>


<P>If you open a resource that does not have an associated editor, the Workbench 
  will attempt to launch an external editor registered with your platform.&nbsp; 
  These external editors are not tightly integrated with the Workbench and are 
  not embedded into the Workbench's editor area.&nbsp; </P>
<P>You can also cycle through the editors using the back and forward arrow buttons 
  in the toolbar and by using the Ctrl+F6 accelerator. The arrow buttons move 
  through the last mouse selection points and allow you to potentially move through 
  several points in a file before moving to another one. Ctrl+F6 pops up a list 
  of currently selected editors with the editor used before the current one selected 
  by default.</P>

  On Windows the Workbench will also attempt to launch the editor in-place as 
  an OLE document editor. For example editing a DOC file will cause Microsoft 
  Word to be opened in-place within the Workbench if you have Microsoft Word installed 
  on your machine. If you have not installed Microsoft Word, Word Pad will open 
  instead. </P>
