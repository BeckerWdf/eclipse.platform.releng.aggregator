<h3>Editing Ant scripts</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">Because Ant scripts are simple text files, you can use any text 
  editor to edit them. But there are several advantages to using the Eclipse Ant 
  editor, including syntax coloring, content assist and an outline view. To get 
  familiar with the Eclipse Ant editor, we will create a simple Ant script using 
  this editor.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Create an Ant script called HelloWorld.xml (see the previous page if necessary).</li>
  <li>Open the Ant editor on the file by selecting Open With&gt;Ant Editor from 
    the file's context menu. Note that the default editor for a .xml file is a 
    simple text editor, but this can be changed in the Window&gt;Preferences&gt;Workbench&gt;File 
    Associations. </li>
  <li>Enter the following content in the editor.<img src="../images/Image600_editor_first_target.jpg" width="505" height="231"></li>
  <li>Notice the syntax coloring for property values.</li>
  <li>Begin to enter a second target by typing '&lt;tar', then hit Ctrl-Space 
    to activate content assist. You are presented with a list of valid completions. 
    In this case there is only one, the &lt;target&gt; tag. Select this completion 
    and notice that the editor inserts both the opening and closing tags and leaves 
    the cursor postioned for you to enter properties for this tag.</li>
  <li>Name this target 'World'.</li>
  <li>Enter an 'echo' task for this target similar to that for the Hello target, 
    but change the text to 'World'.</li>
  <li>Save the changes to HelloWorld.xml.</li>
  <li>Make the Outline view visible and notice that there are entries for each 
    property and each target. In addition, each task under a target has an entry.<br>
    <img src="../images/Image601_outline_hello.jpg" width="244" height="163"></li>
  <li>Clicking on an entry in the Outline view will scroll the editor to that 
    entry. In addition, when the Outline view has focus, typing a character will 
    move the selection in the Outline view to the next visible entry beginning 
    with that character.</li>
  <li>Position the cursor just past the end of one of the '&lt;target&gt;' tags, 
    type '&lt;tar', then hit Ctrl-Space to activate content assist. Notice that 
    now the only valid completion is the 'tar' tag. This is because the Ant editor 
    knows that nested targets are not allowed. Previously, when we used content 
    assist to create a target tag, the editor knew that a tar task was not allowed 
    outside of a target.<br>

  <li>Close the editor and do not save changes.</li>
</ol>
