Replacing</h3>
<p CLASS="Head"> Suppose after further reflection we realize that the revision 
of file1.txt that we just received is incorrect and in fact we want an earlier 
revision. You can replace a Workbench resource with an earlier revision of the 
resource from the repository. To roll back to an earlier revision:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<p CLASS="Head"> In the Navigator view select the file1.txt</p>
  </li>
  <li>
      <P CLASS="Para"> From the file's context menu, select Replace With &gt; 
        Revision...</P>
  </li>
  <li>
      <P CLASS="Para"> In the replace with revision Compare editor that opens, 
        choose the original (bottom) revision and, from the pop-up menu choose 
        Get Contents.</P>
  </li>
  <li>Open the preferences (Window &gt; Preferences) and turn on the CVS label 
  decorations (on page Workbench &gt; Label Decorations and ensure CVS is checked).

      <p>Observe that the Navigator updates to show the CVS state of a resource. 
        Notice that the modified file is preceded by &quot;&gt; (see #1) indicating 
        that we have changed file1.txt (by replacing it with the earlier version).&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image84_replace2.jpg"  alt="File selection" width="220" height="133"></li>
  <li>Now that we have finished our coffee we realize 
      that this older revision is not as good as it initially seemed and in fact 
      the revision in the repository is better after all.&nbsp; <p>Instead of choosing Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository, let's choose 
        Replace With &gt; Latest from Repository.&nbsp;</p> <p>Observe that file1.txt is updated to be the contents from the repository, 
        and that the leading indicator &quot;&gt;&quot; has been removed since 
        we now have the same revision as the repository. 
    </li>
</ol>
<P>We have seen how to synchronize with the repository, replace with revision 
  or replace with the latest from the repository. You can also compare with these 
  revisions/versions in a similar manner by choosing the Compare With menu 
  operation from a resource's context menu in the Navigator. </P>
