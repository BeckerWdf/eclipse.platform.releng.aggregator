<h3> Replacing</h3>
<p CLASS="Head">Suppose after further reflection, it becomes apparent that the 
  revision of file1.txt that was just received is incorrect and an earlier revision 
  is required. A Workbench resource can be replaced with an earlier revision of 
  the resource from the repository. To roll back to an earlier revision:</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Head"> In the Navigator view select the file1.txt.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> From the file's context menu, select <b>Replace With &gt; 
      Revision.</b></P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the replace with revision Compare editor that opens, choose 
      the original (bottom) revision and, from the pop-up menu choose <b>Get Contents</b>.</P>
  </li>
  <li>Open the preferences (<b>Window &gt; Preferences</b>) and turn on the CVS 
    label decorations (on page <b>Workbench &gt; Label Decorations</b> and ensure 
    <b>CVS</b> is checked). 
    <p><img src="../images/Image84_decorator_preference.gif" alt="Decorator Preference" border="0" width="531" height="440"></p>
    <p>Observe that the Navigator updates to show the CVS state of a resource. 
      Notice that the modified file is preceded by &quot;&gt;&quot; (see #1) indicating 
      that file1.txt has changed (by replacing it with the earlier version).&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="../images/Image84_replace2.gif" alt="File selection" border="0" width="227" height="151"></li>
  <li>Now assume that this older revision is not as good as it initially seemed 
    and in fact the revision in the repository is better after all.&nbsp; 
    <p>Instead of choosing <b>Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</b>, choose 
      <b>Replace With &gt; Latest from Repository.</b></p>
    <p>Observe that file1.txt is updated to be the contents from the repository, 
      and that the leading indicator &quot;&gt;&quot; has been removed since it 
      is now the same revision as the repository. </li>
</ol>
<P>Now that how to synchronize with the repository, replace with a revision or 
  replace with the latest from the repository has been explained, these revisions/versions 
  can also be compared with in a similar manner by choosing the <b>Compare With</b> 
  menu operation from a resource's context menu in the Navigator. </P>
