<h3> Replacing</h3>
<p class="Head">Suppose after further reflection, it becomes apparent
that the revision of file1.txt that was just received is incorrect and
an earlier revision is required. A Workbench resource can be replaced
with an earlier revision of the resource from the repository. To roll
back to an earlier revision:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="Head"> In the Navigator view select the file1.txt.<br>
    <br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Para"> From the file's context menu, select <b>Replace
With &gt; Revision.<br>
    <br>
    </b></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Para"> In the replace with revision Compare editor that
opens, choose the original (bottom) revision and, from the pop-up menu
choose <b>Get Contents</b>.<br>
    <br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Observe that the Navigator updates to show the CVS state of a
resource. Notice that the modified file is preceded by "&gt;" (see #1)
indicating that file1.txt has changed (by replacing it with the earlier
version). <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <p><img style="border: 0px solid ; height: 163px; width: 208px;"
 alt="File selection" src="../images/Image84_replace2.gif"><br>
    <br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Now assume that this older revision is not as good as it
initially seemed and in fact the revision in the repository is better
after all.&nbsp;
    <p>Instead of choosing <b>Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</b>,
choose <b>Replace With &gt; Latest from Repository.</b></p>
    <p>Observe that file1.txt is updated to be the contents from the
repository, and that the leading indicator "&gt;" has been removed
since it is now the same revision as the repository. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Now that how to synchronize with the repository, replace with a
revision or replace with the latest from the repository has been
explained, these revisions/versions can also be compared with in a
similar manner by choosing the <b>Compare With</b> menu operation from
a resource's context menu in the Navigator. </p>
