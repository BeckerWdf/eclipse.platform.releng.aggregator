Tiling Editors</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">
The workbench allows you to create two or more sets of editors in the editor
area. You can also resize the editor area but you cannot drag views into the editor
area or tear off editors from&nbsp; the workbench window.</P>

area the stack drop cursor appears.</P>

It is important to observe the color of an editor tab (in the figure below there
are two groups, one above the other)
<p CLASS="Para"><b>blue</b> - indicates that the editor is currently active</p>
<p CLASS="Para"><b>white</b> - indicates that the editor was the last
active editor. If there is an active view, it will be the editor that the active view is currently working with.
This is important when working with views like the Outline and Properties that
work closely with the editor.

Drag and dock the editor somewhere else in the editor area, noting the behavior that results from docking on each kind of drop cursor. Continue to experiment with docking and resizing editors and views until you have arranged the workbench to your satisfaction.
The figure below illustrates the layout if you drag and drop one editor below
another.</P>
