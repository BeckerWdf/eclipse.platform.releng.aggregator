<h2>
The Workbench</h2>
<P CLASS="Para"> When the Workbench is launched a single window is displayed. 
  The Workbench window offers one or more perspectives. A perspective contains 
  editors and views, such as the Navigator. Multiple Workbench windows can be 
  opened simultaneously. Initially, the Resource perspective is displayed, with
  only the Welcome view visible. Click the arrow labeled <b>Workbench</b> in the
  Welcome view to cause the other views in the perspective to become visible.</P>
<p>(You can get the Welcome view back at any time by selecting
  <b>Help > Welcome</b>.)</p>
<p>A shortcut bar appears in the top right corner of the window. This allows the user 
  to open new perspectives and switch between ones already open. The name of the 
  active perspective is shown in the title of the window and its item in the shortcut 
  bar is highlighted.</p>
<p>The title bar of the Workbench window indicates which perspective is active. 
  In this example, the Resource perspective is in use. The Navigator, Tasks, and 
  Outline views are open along with an editor. <br>
