<h3>
Views</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">Views support editors and provide alternative presentations or
navigations of the information in your workbench.&nbsp; For example:</P>
<UL CLASS="UnorderedList">
<LI CLASS="Item">
The Bookmarks view displays all bookmarks in the workbench along with the names
of the files with which the bookmarks are associated.</LI>
<LI CLASS="Item">
The Navigator view displays the projects and other resources that you are working with.</LI>
</UL>
<P CLASS="Para">
A view might appear by itself or stacked with other views in a tabbed notebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>

  </blockquote>

<P CLASS="Para">
To activate a view that is part of a tabbed notebook simply click on its tab. As we will soon discover, the workbench
provides a number of quick and easy ways to configure your environment,
including whether the tabs are at the bottom or top of your notebooks.&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para" align="center">
<img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image3_tabbed.jpg" alt="Two views with tabs, navigator view active" width="241" height="197"></P>
<P CLASS="Para">Views have two menus, the first is a menu associated with the top
left area of the view which allows you to manipulate the view in much the
same manner as the menu associated with the workbench window.</P>
<P CLASS="Para" align="center"><img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image8_view.jpg" alt="Navigator view menu, top left" ></P>
<P CLASS="Para">The second menu is accessed by clicking on the down arrow <img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image9_viewdownarrow.jpg" alt="View down arror">.
The view pull-down menu typically contains operations that apply to the entire
contents of the view, but not to a specific item shown in the view. Operations
for sorting and filtering are commonly found on the view pull-down.&nbsp;</P>

<P CLASS="Para">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
 In the event
 you decided to experiment by rearranging your workbench, this is probably a
 good opportunity to use the Perspective &gt; Reset menu operation. The reset
operation restores the layout&nbsp; to its original state.&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
You can display a view by selecting it from the <b> Window &gt; Show View</b>
menu. A perspective determines the views you are likely to need and shows these on the
Show View submenu. Additional views are available by choosing
Other... at the bottom of the Show View submenu. As we will see later this is
just one of the many features that allows you to build your own custom work
environment.&nbsp;</P>
