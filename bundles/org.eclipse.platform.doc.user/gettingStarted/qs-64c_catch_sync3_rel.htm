<h3> Committing</h3>
<p CLASS="Para"> We will now use the Outgoing Mode of the Synchronize view to 
  commit the one remaining outgoing change.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Place the Synchronize view into outgoing mode 
      by clicking on the Outgoing Mode button (#1) and confirming that the title 
      of the view now indicates we are in Outgoing Mode (#2). 
      <p><img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image84_relmode.jpg" width="438" height="125" alt="Outgoing mode"></p>
      </li>
  <li>Select file3.txt (the outgoing change).&nbsp; </li>
  <li>The comparison viewer shows that&nbsp;our copy 
      of file3.txt has a change to the second line.&nbsp; The repository copy 
      is shown in the right pane. 
      <p><img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image84_jane.jpg" width="552" height="100" alt="Text compare"></li>
  <li>From the context menu of file3.txt choose Commit. 
      Be sure to enter a meaningful description when prompted for one.&nbsp; <p>Your Workbench copy is now committed into the repository.</p>
    </li>
  <li>
<p CLASS="Para"> At this point Fred may want to Synchronize 
      with the repository to update his workspace with the changes you just committed.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<P>We have successfully collaborated with Fred by making simultaneous changes 
  to the same project. The Synchronization view&nbsp; and CVS Repository History 
  view allowed us to determine the specific changes each user was making and to 
  quickly stay on top of the ongoing changes being committed into the repository. 
</P>
