Comparing</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">
The Workbench allows us to compare multiple resources and present the results
in a special compare editor. </P>
<P CLASS="Para"><b>Setup</b> </P>
<P CLASS="Para">Before we get started with compare we need to create a few
files. This will also be a good time to recap some of the basic features we have
already learned about. </P>
<ol>
  <li>
        <p CLASS="Para">Start by selecting all of the projects in the Navigator
        and deleting them by using Delete on the pop-up menu.</p>
      </li>
  <li>
        <p CLASS="Para">Create a new simple project using File &gt; New &gt;
        Project.... Be sure to give the project a distinct name&nbsp;by typing
        your name as the name of your new project (e.g., &quot;JaneQUserCompare&quot;).
        Do not use spaces or special characters in the project name.</li>
  <li>
        <p CLASS="Para">Use the project's pop-up menu to create a file called
        file1.txt.</p>
        <p CLASS="Para">In the editor for file1.txt type the following lines of
        text and save the file:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p CLASS="Para"><i>This is line 1.<br>
          This is line 2.<br>
          This is line 3.<br>
          This is line 4.<br>
          This is line 5.</i></p>
        </blockquote>
      </li>
  <li>
        <p CLASS="Para">In the Navigator select
        file1.txt and use Ctrl+C to copy the file.</li>
  <li>
        <p CLASS="Para">Use Ctrl+V (Paste) to create the copy. In the name
        conflict dialog which appears, rename the file to file2.txt.</li>
</ol>
<P>We now have two files, file1.txt and file2.txt that are identical. Let's 
have some fun with the compare feature.
</P>
