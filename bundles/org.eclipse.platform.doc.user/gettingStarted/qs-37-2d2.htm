Associated tasks</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">
Associated tasks are associated with a specific location in a resource. To
associate a task with our&nbsp;JanesFile.txt:</P>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Open a text file (JanesFile.txt) by double clicking on it 
      in the Navigator view.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the editor area directly to the left of any line in the 
      text editor, access the context menu from the marker bar. The marker bar 
      is the vertical bar to the left of the main text area.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> From the marker bar's context menu, select Add Task.</P>
    <P CLASS="Para"> The marker bar displays any marker including bookmarks, task 
      markers (for associated tasks), and/or debugging breakpoints. You can associate 
      various markers with specific lines in a file by accessing the context menu 
      from the marker bar directly to the left of that line.</P>
    <P CLASS="Para"> <img src="../images/Image53_marker1.gif" alt="Marker bar menu" border="0" width="299" height="153"></P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the <i>Description</i> field, type a brief description 
      for the task you want to associate with that line in the text file.</P>
    <blockquote> 
      <P CLASS="Para"> <img src="../images/Image53_add_task_dlg.gif" alt="Add Task dialog" border="0" width="611" height="256"></P>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Click OK when you are done.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Notice that a new task marker appears in the marker bar, 
      directly to the left of the line where you added the task. Also, notice 
      that the new task appears in the Tasks view.</P>
    <P CLASS="Para"> <img src="../images/Image53_task_updated.gif" alt="Tasks view" border="0" width="425" height="312"></P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> After you have added the new task, click in the editor on 
      the first line or any other line above the line with which the new task 
      is associated.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Add several lines of text to the file at this point.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Notice that as you add lines of text above it, the task marker 
      moves down in the marker bar in order to remain with the associated line 
      in the file. The line number in the Tasks view is updated when the file 
      is saved.&nbsp;</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the Tasks view, access the context menu for the task 
      you just created.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Select Mark Completed. </P>
  </li>
  <li>Now select Delete Completed Tasks from the marker's context menu.</li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Notice that the task marker disappears from the marker bar 
      and the task is removed from the Tasks view.</P>
  </li>
