<h2>
Working with another user</h2>
<P>We have seen how to create a project and commit it to the repository. We
first specified our repository location. Next we shared our project with that location and
the HEAD branch.  Then we synchronized our project to open the Synchronize view.  Finally
we committed the resources using the Synchronize view.
</P>


<P>The repository currently contains our project and the three files that we
committed (file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt).
</P>


<P>It's time to find that coworker (let's call him Fred) to work through some
steps with you. In this section we will learn how two people can work on the
same project and simultaneously commit changes to the repository.  Specifically
we will do the following:
</P>

<ul>
  <li>Fred will add the project to his Workbench</li>
  <li>Fred will make changes to file1.txt and file2.txt</li>
  <li>You will simultaneously make changes to file2.txt and file3.txt</li>
  <li>Fred will synchronize and commit his (outgoing) changes to the two files.</li>
  <li>You will synchronize to commit your changes at which time you
    will discover there are outgoing (file3.txt), incoming (file1.txt) and
    conflicts (file2.txt).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
