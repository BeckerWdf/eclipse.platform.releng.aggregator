<h2> Files </h2>
<p CLASS="Para">Here are directions to locate where files are stored.</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Start by opening the operating system's file system explorer.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Navigate to the location of where the Workbench was installed. 
      Select a sub-directory called &quot;workspace&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">The projects, folders and files that were created can be found 
      in the workspace sub-directory. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p CLASS="Para">All of the resources are stored as normal files and folders on 
  the machine. This allows the use of other tools when working with the files. 
  Those tools can be completely oblivious to the Workbench. A later section will 
  look at how to work with external editors that are not integrated into the Workbench.</p>
