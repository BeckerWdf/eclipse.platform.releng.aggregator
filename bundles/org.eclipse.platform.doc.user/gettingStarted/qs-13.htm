my files stored?&quot;. Perhaps you are even a little concerned they are stored
in some mystical repository.&nbsp; Answering this question is easy.</p>

and folders on your machine. This allows you to use other tools for working with
your files. Those tools can be completely oblivious to the workbench. In a later

integrated into the workbench.</p>
