Perspectives</h2>
<p class="Para" Type Label>A perspective defines the initial set and layout of
views in the Workbench window. One or more perspectives can exist in a single
Workbench window.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Para" Type Label>Perspectives can be opened in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the same (existing) Workbench window</p>
  <li>
    In a new Workbench window</p>
</ul>
<p class="Para" Type Label>Perspectives define visible action sets, which you
can change to customize a perspective.&nbsp; You can save a perspective that you
build in this manner, making your own custom perspective that you can open again
later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<P CLASS="Para">
 The Workbench window displays one or more perspectives. Initially one perspective,
 the Resource perspective,&nbsp; is displayed. A perspective consists of views
 like the Navigator as well as editors for working with resources.
More than one Workbench window can be open at any given time.&nbsp; </P>
<P CLASS="Para">
So far we have only used the Resource
perspective (shown below). In this section we will explore how to open and work with
other perspectives. </P>
<P CLASS="Para">
A perspective provides us with a set of capabilities aimed at accomplishing a
specific type of task, or working with a specific type of
resource.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>
