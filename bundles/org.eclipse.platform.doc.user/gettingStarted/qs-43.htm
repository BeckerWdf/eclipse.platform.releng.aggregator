Perspectives</h2>
<p class="Para" Type Label>A perspective defines the initial set and layout of
views in the Workbench window. One or more perspectives can exist in a single
Workbench window.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Para" Type Label>Perspectives can be opened in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li> In the same (existing) Workbench window.</p> 
  <li> In a new Workbench window.</p> 
</ul>
<p class="Para" Type Label>Perspectives define visible action sets, which can 
  be changed to customize a perspective. A perspective that is built in this manner 
  can be saved, creating a custom perspective that can be opened again later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<P CLASS="Para"> The Workbench window displays one or more perspectives. Initially 
  one perspective, the Resource perspective, is displayed. A perspective consists 
  of views such as the Navigator as well as editors for working with resources. 
  More than one Workbench window can be open at any given time.&nbsp; </P>
<P CLASS="Para"> So far, only the Resource perspective (shown below) has been 
  used in this tutorial. This section will explore how to open and work with other 
  perspectives. </P>
<P CLASS="Para"> A perspective provides a set of capabilities aimed at accomplishing 
  a specific type of task, or working with a specific type of resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;
