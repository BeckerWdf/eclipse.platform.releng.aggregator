<h3>Using the Ant view</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para">Eclipse provides a standard view, the Ant view, that lets you 
  work with your Ant scripts. This view is tree-structured, showing Ant scripts 
  as top-level entries and targets &amp; subtargets as children. The main advantage 
  of this view is that you can work with all of your Ant scripts in one place, 
  as opposed to hunting them down in the Navigator.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Ant view from the workbench menu by selecting Window&gt;Show View&gt;Other...&gt;Ant&gt;Ant.</li>
  <li>By default, the Ant view is empty. There are 2 ways to add Ant scripts to 
    this view: 
    <ul>
      <li>Click the 'Add Build File' button. This brings up a dialog in which 
        you explicitly select those Ant scripts you want to add</li>
      <li>Click the 'Add Build Files with Search' button. This brings up a search 
        dialog in which you can specify a filename pattern for your Ant scripts 
        and search within the entire workspace or a specified working set</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once added to the Ant view, Ant script entries remain in the view across 
    workbench invocations until explicitly removed.</li>
  <li>Click the Add Build Files with Search button. Suppose you only remember 
    that the script you want to work with starts with 'H'. Enter 'H*.xml' for 
    the build file name. Make sure Workspace is selected for the scope, then click 
    Search. The HelloWorld.xml file is found and placed in the Ant view.</li>
  <li>Expand the top-level entry to see the default target Hello, and the subtarget 
    World.<br>

  <li>Select the World subtarget and click the Play button. Notice that just the 
    World subtarget gets executed. </li>
  <li>Select the top-level HelloWorld build file and click Play. Notice that just 
    the default target, Hello, gets executed.</li>
  <li>To edit your script, bring up the context menu on the HelloWorld file and 
    select Open With&gt;Ant Editor.</li>
  <li>To edit the default launch configuration, select Properties... from the 
    context menu.</li>
  <li>The Run Ant dialog appears. Here you can modify the way in which the script 
    is run from the Ant view. Note that the choice and order of targets is ignored 
    when running from the Ant view. If the top-level file is selected, just the 
    default target is run and if one of the targets or subtargets is selected, 
    just that target is run. It is not possible to run multiple targets from the 
    Ant view.</li>
  <li>Select the HelloWorld file, then click the Remove button. The script is 
    removed from the view. Note that this does not delete the file from the workspace.</li>
</ol>
