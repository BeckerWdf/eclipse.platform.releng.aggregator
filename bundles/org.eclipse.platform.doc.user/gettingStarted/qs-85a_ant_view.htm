<h3>Using the Ant view</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para">Eclipse provides a standard view, the Ant view, that lets you 
  work with your Ant buildfiles. This view is tree-structured, showing Ant buildfiles 
  as top-level entries and targets &amp; internal targets as children. The main advantage 
  of this view is that you can work with all of your Ant buildfiles in one place, 
  as opposed to hunting them down in the Navigator.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Ant view from the workbench menu by selecting <b>Window &gt; Show 
    View &gt; Ant</b>.</li>
  <li>By default, the Ant view is empty. There are two ways to add Ant buildfiles 
    to this view: 
    <ul>
      <li>Click <strong>Add Buildfile<img src="../images/image618-add-ant.gif" alt="Ant view" border="0" width="28" height="23"></strong>. 
        This brings up a dialog in which you explicitly select those Ant buildfiles 
        you want to add</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Add Buildfiles with Search<img src="../images/image618-add-ant-search.gif" alt="Ant view" border="0" width="22" height="22"></strong>. 
        This brings up a search dialog in which you can specify a filename pattern 
        for your Ant buildfiles and search within the entire workspace or a specified 
        working set.<br>
        <br>
        Once added to the Ant view, Ant buildfile entries remain in the view across 
        workbench invocations until explicitly removed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add Buildfiles with Search</strong>. Suppose you only remember 
    that the buildfile you want to work with starts with 'H'. Enter 'H*.xml' for 
    the buildfile name. Make sure Workspace is selected for the scope, then click 
    Search. The HelloWorld.xml file is found and placed in the Ant view.</li>
  <li>Expand the top-level entry to see the default target Hello, and the internal 
    target World.<br>
    <img src="../images/Image618_ant_view.gif" alt="Ant view" border="0" width="178" height="106"> 
  </li>
  <li>Select the World internal target and click <strong>Run the Default Target 
    of the Selected Buildfile <img src="../images/image618-ant-run.gif" alt="Ant view" border="0" width="27" height="23"></strong>. 
    Notice that just the World target gets executed. </li>
  <li>Select the top-level HelloWorld buildfile and click <strong>Run the Default 
    Target of the Selected Buildfile</strong>. Notice that just the default target, 
    Hello, gets executed.</li>
  <li>To edit your buildfile, bring up the context menu on the HelloWorld file 
    and select <b>Open With &gt; Ant Editor</b>.</li>
  <li>To edit the default launch configuration, select <strong>Properties... </strong>from 
    the context menu.</li>
  <li>The Run Ant dialog appears. Here you can modify the way in which the buildfile 
    is run from the Ant view. If the top-level file is selected, just the default 
    target is run and if one of the targets or internal targets is selected, just 
    that target is run. It is not possible to run multiple targets from the Ant 
    view. <strong><br>
    Note</strong>: The choice and order of targets is ignored when running from 
    the Ant view. </li>
  <li>Select the HelloWorld file, then click the Remove button. The buildfile 
    is removed from the view.<br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: This does not delete the file from the workspace.</li>
</ol>
