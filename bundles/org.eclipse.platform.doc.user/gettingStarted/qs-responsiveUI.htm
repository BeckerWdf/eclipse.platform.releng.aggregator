<h2> Responsive UI</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">By default all Eclipse operations run in the user interface thread. 
  Employing the Responsive UI, which allows the threading of sequential code, 
  will enable you to continue working elsewhere in Eclipse. Without the Responsive 
  UI activated in the user interface thread, you would be locked out of performing 
  any other actions when met with a slow operation.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">While those operations with auto build on will automatically run 
  in the background, in many cases a dialog will be displayed providing you with 
  the option to run an operation in the background. For example, building a project 
  can sometimes take more than a few minutes, during which time you may wish to 
  continue to use other functions in Eclipse. 
<P CLASS="Para"><img src="../images/res.gif" alt="Image of the Build All Menu Item." border="0" width="230" height="260"> 
<p>While the project is being built, select <strong>Run in Background </strong>from 
  the <strong>Building Workspace</strong> dialog and the Responsive UI will allow 
  you to carry on with other tasks in Eclipse.</p>
<p><img src="../images/res_build.gif" alt="Image of the Building Workspace window" border="0" width="447" height="197"></p>
<p>For information on the status of the action and additional operations that 
  are currently running, click <strong>Details</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="../images/res_details.gif" alt="Image of the Building Workspace window with the Details displayed" border="0" width="406" height="129"></p>
<p>The <strong>Details </strong>panel displays the status information of the operation 
  at hand as well as any additional operations that may be running simultaneously.</P>
<p><img src="../images/res_otherjobs.gif" alt="Image of the Building Workspace window with the Details showing simultaneous operations" border="0" width="450" height="328"></P>
<p>The Progress Information view also indicates when one operation is being blocked 
  by another. </P>

<p>To have operations running in the background set as the default, select <strong>Window 
  &gt; Preferences &gt; Workbench</strong> and check <strong>Always run in background.</strong>
