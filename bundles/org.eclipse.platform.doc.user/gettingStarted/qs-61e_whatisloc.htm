<h3>What is a repository location?</h3>
<DIV CLASS="Subtopic">

  <p CLASS="Para">We have just added a new repository location to the CVS Repositories 
    view. This is probably a good time to ask ourselves what a repository location 
    is or, more importantly, what it isn't.</p>
  <p CLASS="Para">A repository location is not an actual live connection. Instead, 
    it is a description of where the repository is located. At a later time, when 
    we are committing work to the repository or updating with work done by others, 
    the Workbench will create a connection based on this location information.&nbsp; 
    Connections will be opened and closed as required when performing CVS team 
    operations, and those connections will be based on the information you provided 
    in the repository location. </p>
  <p CLASS="Para">Suppose we disconnected from the network and went home. The 
    CVS Repositories view would continue to show us the list of known repository 
    locations. In addition, the projects themselves will 
    still know the repository location they are associated with.
