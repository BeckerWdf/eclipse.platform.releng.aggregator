  <h1>Repository locations</h1>
  <div class="Subtopic">
    <p class="Para">Now that a new repository location has been added to the CVS Repositories view, the following will
    explain what a repository location is or, more importantly, what it isn't.</p>
    <p class="Para">A repository location is not an actual live connection. Instead, it is a description of where the
    repository is located. At a later time, when instructions are given explaining how to commit work to the repository
    or update with work done by others, the Workbench will create a connection based on this location information.
    Connections will be opened and closed as required when performing CVS team operations, and those connections will
    be based on the information provided in the repository location.</p>
    <p class="Para">When disconnected from the network the CVS Repositories view continues to display the list of known
    repository locations. In addition, the projects themselves will still know the repository location they are
    associated with.</p>
