Tasks and markers</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">
There are several types of markers including bookmarks, task markers, debugging
breakpoints and problems. In this section we will focus on tasks and the Tasks
view.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
The Tasks view displays all the tasks and problems in the workbench, both those associated with specific files (and even with specific lines in specific files)
as well as&nbsp; generic
tasks that are not associated with any specific file.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
In the figure below, &quot;sample task&quot; is a generic task not associated
with any specific resource. The second task (&quot;add sixth line to the
text&quot;) is associated with the file JanesFile.txt.</P>
