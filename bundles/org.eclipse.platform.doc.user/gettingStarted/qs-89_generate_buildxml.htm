<h4>Generating the build.xml file</h4>
  
<P CLASS="Para">Open a Navigator view and locate your new plugin project.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Select the file 'plugin.xml' underneath your new project and right-click 
    'Create Ant Build File'.</li>
  <li>A new file, 'build.xml' will be created underneath your project.</li>
  <li>Open the Ant editor on the build.xml file by double clicking it in the Navigator. 
    Notice that for this file, the Ant editor is the default editor. This is because 
    by default, there is a file association in the workbench preferences associating 
    files named 'build.xml' with the Ant editor. <br>

</ol>
<p>The build.xml file is a default Ant script with many targets useful for deploying 
  your plugin. For example, there are individual targets to build all necessary 
  jars for your plugin, create a .zip file containing everything in your plugin, 
  cleanup any .zip files that may have been created and so on. </p>
<p>Now that we have the build.xml file, we will use it to build a .jar file for 
  our plugin.</p>
