Synchronize view</h3>
<p CLASS="Para">
If you look closely at the
title of the Synchronize view you will see that we have started in Catch Up Mode
(see #1). This is because there are changes in the stream that we should first
integrate before releasing our own changes.</p>
<p CLASS="Para"><img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image83_jane2b.jpg" width="482" height="387"></p>
<p CLASS="Para">It is important to first catch up to changes made to the stream, retest with
those changes loaded locally with your soon-to-be-released changes and then release your
changes.&nbsp; By first taking the latest stream changes, and retesting, it helps
to ensure that the changes you are about to release will actually work with the
current state of the stream.</p>
