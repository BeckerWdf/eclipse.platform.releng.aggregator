<h3>Working with conflicting changes<br>
</h3>
<p class="Para">There are cases were two users are editing the same
files and when the second to commit to the repository tried to commit
their changes, the repository won't allow the commit to succeed before
of the conflict. Let's simulate this by making Fred and Jane change the
same files.<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In Fred's workspace open the navigator and edit file1.txt. Make
the text the following:<br>
    <br style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Fred line 1</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">This is the contents</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Fred-update</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">of file 1.<br>
    <br>
    </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>Fred will also change
file2.txt with the following change:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">File2 is a (Fred was here again)
small file</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">with simple text.</span><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Fred committed his changes to the repository.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Next, at the same time Jane was making changes to file1.txt. She
added the following line to the end of the file:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">This is the contents</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Fred-update</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">of file 1.</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Jane was at the end<br>
    <br>
    </span></li>
  <li>And finally, Jane changed file2.txt to the following:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">File2 is a (Jane was here) small
file</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
    <span style="font-style: italic;">with simple text.<br>
    <br>
    </span></li>
  <li>When Jane was finished making changes she synchronized the
project and found the following appear in the Synchronize View:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="../images/Image83_jane3_conflict.gif" alt=""
 style="width: 739px; height: 439px;"><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Both file1.txt and file2.txt show with a red icon indicating that
they have conflicting changes. You can't commit the files until the
conflicts are resolved. Click on file1.txt and notice that Fred and
Jane made changes to two different parts of the file. In this case,
Jane can simply update the file and the lines added by Fred will be
merged into Jane's local file. Select file1.txt and from the context
menu select Update.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Next, double on file2.txt to see the conflict. In this case you
can see that both Jane and Fred changed the same line. For this type of
conflicting change a regular update can't resolve the conflict. Here
you are three options with the command to use in brackets: accept the
changes from Fred (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Override and Update</span>),
ignore Fred's changes (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mark as Merged</span>),
or manually merge the files within the compare editor.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="../images/Image83_jane3_conflict2.gif" alt=""
 style="width: 522px; height: 172px;"><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>For this example, let's say Jane updated file1.txt and selected
override and update for file2.txt. After the operations are run the
conflicts turn into outgoing changes. Jane can review the changes and
commit them.<br>
  </li>
