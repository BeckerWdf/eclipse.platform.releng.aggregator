Synchronize view</h3>
<p CLASS="Para"> If you look closely at the title of the Synchronize view you 
  will see that we have started in Incoming Mode (see #1). This is because there 
  are changes in the repository that we should first integrate before committing 
  our own changes.</p>
<p CLASS="Para"><img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image83_jane2b.jpg" width="522" height="485" alt="Incoming mode"></p>
<p CLASS="Para">It is important to first update changes made to the repository, 
  retest with those changes loaded locally with your soon to be committed changes 
  and then commit your changes.&nbsp; By first taking the latest repository changes, 
  and retesting, it helps to ensure that the changes you are about to commit will 
  actually work with the current state of the repository.</p>
