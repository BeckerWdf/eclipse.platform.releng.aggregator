Synchronize view</h3>
<p CLASS="Para"> Looking closely at the title of the Synchronize view, see that 
  it has started in Incoming Mode (see #1). This is because there are changes 
  in the repository that should first be integrated before committing changes.</p>
<p CLASS="Para"><img src="../images/Image83_jane2b.gif" alt="Incoming mode" border="0" width="503" height="457"></p>
<p CLASS="Para">It is important to first update changes made to the repository, 
  retest with those changes loaded locally with the soon to be committed changes 
  and then commit the changes.&nbsp; By first taking the latest repository changes, 
  and retesting, it helps to ensure that the changes about to be committed will 
  actually work with the current state of the repository.</p>
