<h3>Creating Ant buildfiles</h3>
  
<P CLASS="Para"> Ant buildfiles are just text files, so the most straightforward 
  way to create an Ant buildfile in Eclipse is:</P>
<ol>
  <li><b>File &gt; New &gt; File</b>.</li>
  <li>Enter a name for the file.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Finish</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default the Ant editor only has an association with build.xml named files.
As the user you can designate for the Ant editor to be considered for all xml
files.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; Editors &gt;File Associations</b></li>
<li>Add an association between *.xml and the Ant editor.</li></ol>

<p>Now, as long as the file has a .xml extension, Eclipse will consider it to be a 
  possible Ant buildfile, and will enable Ant-related actions when it is selected.
  Until a file has Ant buildfile content, you will need to open it using <b>Open With &gt; Ant Editor</b>.</p>
<p>As will be demonstrated in a later section, an Ant buildfile can be created 
  for an Eclipse plug-in that contains predefined targets that are useful for deploying 
  the plug-in.</p>
