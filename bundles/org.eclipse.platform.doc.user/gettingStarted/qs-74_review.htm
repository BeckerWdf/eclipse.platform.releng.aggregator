A quick review</h3>
<p CLASS="Para"> Now that we have experienced the fun of working in a repository 
  it's time to step back and take note of some of the more important but subtle 
  issues.
<ul>
  <li>When we versioned the project we did so by versioning the project as it 
    appeared in our Workbench. For this reason it is important to synchronize 
    the project with the repository (i.e. HEAD or the branch we are working in) 
    prior to versioning it. Otherwise another user may have committed interesting 
    changes to the project which you have yet to update to. If you proceed to 
    version the project without updating, you will version it without these changes.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The repository contains all projects in the repository. Individual users 
    pick which projects they are interested in and check them out into the workspace. 
    From that point on they are synchronizing those projects (only) with respect 
    to the repository.</li>
  <li>The repository represents a large in-progress collection of all known projects. 
    From the repository's perspective, everything in HEAD or on a branch is always 
    open for change.</li>
  <li>The act of versioning a project effectively snapshots it and places it into 
    the Versions section of the repository, however the repository branches are 
    still open for change.</li>
  <li>It is important to first update to changes made to the repository, retest 
    with those changes and your soon to be committed changes and then commit your 
    changes.&nbsp; By first taking the latest changes in the branch, and retesting, 
    it helps to ensure that the changes you are about to commit will actually 
    work with the current state of the branch.</li>
  <li>Each project is associated with a specific repository. Different projects 
    can be associated with different repositories that may be on completely 
    different servers.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
