<title>Ant buildfiles as project builders</title>

<h1>Ant buildfiles as project builders</h1>
  
<p>Our second practical example of using Ant buildfiles in Eclipse 
  is a 'project builder'. This is an Ant buildfile that has been designated to 
  run whenever a project is built. The uses for such a buildfile are many:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generate a <code>.jar</code> file containing class files from your project</li>
  <li>Perform some type of pre- or post-build processing on source or binary files 
    in your project. For example: 
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-processing source files to instrument them for performance analysis</li>
      <li>Obfuscating binary files to prevent reverse engineering</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Copy class files to some location (for instance, on a network)</li>
</ul>
<p>For this example, we will create an Ant buildfile that creates a <code>.jar</code> archive 
  of the class files in a project. Note that this is similar to the example in 
  the last chapter, in which we used an Ant buildfile to generate <code>.jar</code> files for 
  an Eclipse plug-in. This example differs in that it works for any Eclipse project,
  whether or not it is also an Eclipse plug-in.</p>
