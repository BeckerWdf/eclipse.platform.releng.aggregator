<h3>
Versioning your project</h3>
<P CLASS="Para"> Now that our project is complete it is time to version it. If 
  you were paying close attention while we were committing our file resources 
  you probably noticed that the repository automatically assigned them version 
  numbers, or to be more accurate &quot;revision numbers&quot;. As we released 
  our files the only information we needed to supply was a commit comment.&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para">To version our
project proceed as follows:</P>
<ol>
  <li>
<P CLASS="Para">Select the project JanesTeamProject.</P>
  </li>
  <li>In the Navigator view select Team &gt; Tag as Version...</li>
  <li>When the Tag Resources dialog opens enter the version name A1 and click 
        OK.</li>
  <li>Select the CVS Repositories view.</li>
  <li>Expand Versions, and JanesTeamProject. Observe that under JaneTeamProject there 
        is now a version of this project whose version number is A1. Looking closely 
        at the contents of folder1 you can also see that the version numbers of 
        the individual files match the version numbers in our Workbench.
