<h3>
Making our own changes</h3>
<p CLASS="Para">Fred has made several changes to file1.txt and file2.txt and committed 
  them to the repository. We now need to make some changes for ourselves and&nbsp; then synchronize with the repository. When we synchronize we expect to see the 
  changes we have made along with changes that have been made by Fred.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start by modifying file2.txt as follows
<p>Original Contents:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>File2 is a <b>Jane-update </b>small file<br>
  with simple text.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>New Contents: (changes shown in bold)</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><i>This is the <b>Jane-update </b>contents<br>
    of file 2.&nbsp;</i></p>
</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Modify file3.txt as follows
<p>Original Contents:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>This is the brief contents<br>
  of file 3</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>New Contents:(changes shown in bold)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>This is the brief contents<br>
  of file <b>(Jane was here) </b>3</i></p>
</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li> 
      <P CLASS="Para">Open the preferences (Window &gt; Preferences) and turn on 
      the CVS label decorations (on page Workbench &gt; Label Decorations and 
      ensure CVS is checked).</P>
<blockquote>
  <P CLASS="Para"><img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image84_decorator_preference.jpg" alt="Navigator View" width="606" height="532" ></P>
</blockquote>
      <P CLASS="Para">Observe that the Navigator updates the CVS state 
      of a resource. Notice that the two files which Fred has changed are 
      preceded by &quot;&gt;&quot;.</P>
<blockquote>
  <P CLASS="Para"><img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image83_jane1.jpg" alt="Navigator View" width="236" height="160" ></P>
</blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
<P CLASS="Para">
Select the project (JanesTeamProject)</P>
  </li>
  <li>
      <P CLASS="Para"> From the project's context menu, select Team &gt; Synchronize 
        with Repository.</P>
  </li>
  <li>There are a couple of other things worth observing. First, the icon next 
        to file1.txt (in the structured compare area) indicates that file1.txt 
        has an incoming change. This means a change was released to the server 
        which you need to take. Looking at file2.txt we can see a red icon. This indicates that both yourself and the repository have changes 
        to the same file. This means that someone else (namely Fred) made changes 
        to the same resource as the one you want to commit.<p>The second thing worth noting is that the status bar has red text indicating
what changes need to be considered.</p>
<p><img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image83_jane3_status.jpg" alt="Status line" width="379" height="27" ></li>
  <li>Select file1.txt (the incoming change). The comparison viewer shows:&nbsp;
<p><img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image83_jane4.jpg" alt="Compare View" width="615" height="154">
  </li>
</ol>
