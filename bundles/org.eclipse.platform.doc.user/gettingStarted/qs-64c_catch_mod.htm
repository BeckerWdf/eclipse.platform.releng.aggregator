<h3>Making our own changes</h3>

<p>Fred has made several changes to file1.txt and
file2.txt and committed them to the repository. In this section
additional changes will be made and then synchronized with the
repository. When synchronizing, expect to see the changes made in this
section along with changes that have been made by Fred.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Add file3.txt as follows:
    <div class="FileContentsDescription">New contents: (add the following lines to the file)
        <pre class="FileContents">
This is the brief contents
of file 3</pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Observe that the Navigator displays the CVS state of a resources. Notice 
    that the new file added by Jane is preceded by "&gt;".
    <img class ="Big" src="../images/Image83_jane1.png" alt="Navigator View">
  </li>
  <li>Select the project <em class="ProjectName">JanesTeamProject</em> 
      and from the project's context menu, select 
      <em class="UILabel">Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</em>. 
      When asked to switch perspective select 
      <em class="UILabel">Yes</em>. The Team Synchronizing perspective will 
      open and you will see the files you have changed appear in the Synchronize 
      View. Double click on file1.txt and you should see a compare editor open:
	  <img class="Big" src="../images/Image83_jane-sync.png" alt="Synchronize View">
  </li>
  <li>There are a couple of other things worth observing. First, the icon next 
    to file1.txt (in the structured compare area) indicates that file1.txt has 
    an incoming change. This means a change was released to the server which you 
    need to take. Looking at file1.txt we can see the text that Fred has added 
    to the file. Also, notice at the bottom of the window, in the status line, 
    there are arrows with numbers beside them. These show the number of files 
    you have incoming, outgoing, and in conflict. The first number beside a file 
    is the revision you have in the workspace, and the other is the revision on 
    the server when you last synchronized.
  </li>
  <li>Normally you should update the changes made by others, then test your workspace 
    with the changes, then commit your changes once you are sure that the new 
    changes by others didn't break anything in your workspace.
  </li>
  <li>Before deciding to accept Fred's changes you may want to find out why he 
    made the changes. Select file1.txt and from the context menu select 
    <em class="UILabel">Show in History</em>.
    <img class ="Big" src="../images/Image83_jane-history.png" alt="History View"/>
  </li>
  <li>The row starting with a * indicates 
      that this is the current revision loaded. In this case you can see the comment 
      made by Fred when he released revision 1.2.
       <p class="Tip">
          <b>Tip</b>: You can select the <em class="UILabel">Link with 
          Editor and Selection</em> toolbar button in the History view to have the history automatically 
          update when a new editor is opened or when the selection changes. This allows for quick browsing of comments.
       </p>
  </li>
  <li>To update simply select <em class="ProjectName">JanesTeamProject</em> 
      in the Synchronize View and from the context menu select 
      <em class="UILabel">Update</em>.
  </li>
  <li>The Synchronize View will update to reflect the fact that file1.txt and 
      file2.txt are no longer out-of-sync with the repository. You should only have 
      file3.txt visible now.
  </li>
  <li>Next you can commit file3.txt.
  </li>
</ol>
