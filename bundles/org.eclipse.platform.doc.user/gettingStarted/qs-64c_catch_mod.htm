<h3>
Making our own changes</h3>
<p class="Para">Fred has made several changes to file1.txt and
file2.txt and committed them to the repository. In this section
additional changes will be made and then synchronized with the
repository. When synchronizing, expect to see the changes made in this
section along with changes that have been made by Fred.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start by modifying file2.txt as follows
    <p>Original contents:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>File2 is a <b>Jane-update </b>small file<br>
with simple text.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>New contents: (changes shown in bold)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>This is the <b>Jane-update </b>contents<br>
of file 2.&nbsp;</i></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Add file3.txt as follows
    <p>New contents:(changes shown in bold)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>This is the brief contents<br>
of file<b> </b>3</i></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Observe that the Navigator updates the CVS state of a resource.
Notice that the two files which Fred has changed are preceded by "&gt;".
    <blockquote>
      <p class="Para"><img
 style="border: 0px solid ; height: 240px; width: 279px;"
 alt="Navigator View" src="../images/Image83_jane1.gif"></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Para">Select the project <span style="font-weight: bold;">JanesTeamProject</span>
and from the project's context menu, select <b>Team &gt; Synchronize
with Repository</b>. When asked to switch perspective select <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Yes</span>. The Team Synchronizing
perspective will open and you will see the files you have changed
appear in the Synchronize View. Double click on file1.txt and you
should see a compare editor open:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="../images/Image83_jane-sync.gif" alt=""
 style="width: 759px; height: 480px;"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>There are a couple of other things worth observing. First, the
icon next to file1.txt (in the structured compare area) indicates that
file1.txt has an incoming change. This means a change was released to
the server which you need to take. Looking at file1.txt we can see the
text that Fred has added to the file. Also, notice at the bottom of the
window, in the status line, there are arrows with numbers beside them.
These show the number of files you have incoming, outgoing, and in
conflict. The first number beside a file is the revision you have in
the workspace, and the other is the revision on the server when you
last synchronized.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Normally you should update the changes made by others, then test
your workspace with the changes, then commit your changes once you are
sure that the new changes by others didn't break anything in your
workspace. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Before deciding to accept Fred's changes you may want to find out
why he made the changes. Select file1.txt and from the context menu
select <span style="font-weight: bold;">Show in Resource History</span>.<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img
 src="../images/Image83_jane-history.gif" alt=""
 style="width: 482px; height: 162px;"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The row starting with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">*</span>
indicates that this is the current revision loaded. In this case you
can see the comment made by Fred when he released revision 1.3. <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Trick</span>: You can select the
'link with editor' toolbar button in the history view to have the
history automatically update when a new editor is opened. This allows
for quick browsing of comments.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>To update simply select <span style="font-weight: bold;">JanesTeamProject</span>
in the Synchronize View and from the context menu select <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>&nbsp;The Synchronize View will update to reflect the fact that
file1.txt and file2.txt are no longer out-of-sync with the repository.
You should only have file3.txt visible now.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Next you can commit file3.txt.<br>
    <p><br>
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
