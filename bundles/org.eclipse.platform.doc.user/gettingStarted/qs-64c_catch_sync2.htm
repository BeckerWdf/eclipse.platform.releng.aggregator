<h3> Updating</h3>
<p CLASS="Para"> We will now use the Synchronize view to update our local resource 
  to the latest contents in the repository and to commit our changes.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Confirm that the Synchronize view is in Incoming 
      Mode (#1). If it is not then press the Incoming Mode button on the local toolbar 
      (#2). 
      <p><img src="../images/Image83_jane5a.gif" alt="Incoming mode" border="0" width="465" height="451"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Open file1.txt (the incoming change) by double-clicking. The comparison 
    viewer shows that&nbsp;the repository copy of file1.txt has a new line inserted 
    (Fred-update). 
    <p><img src="../images/Image83_jane4.gif" alt="Text Compare" border="0" width="444" height="195"></li>
  <li>
<p CLASS="Para"> From the context menu of file1.txt choose <b>Update</b>. 
      This will cause your Workbench to be updated with the repository copy of 
      file1.txt. </p>
  </li>
  <li>Select file2.txt. The comparison viewer shows that&nbsp;the repository copy of
file1.txt and our copy of file1.txt have both had the exact same line
modified.&nbsp;
<p><img src="../images/Image83_jane6a.gif" alt="Text Compare" border="0" width="670" height="186"></li>
  <li>If you are suspicious of the change you may want to find out some more information
about it. To do this you first need to figure out who made the change
and why.
<p>In the Structure compare pane of the Synchronize view select file2.txt and choose <b>Show in Resource
History</b> from the context menu.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Image84_reshist.gif" alt="Resource History" border="0" width="442" height="152"></p>
  </li>
  <li>In the Resource History view (see above) we can see there is a * next to 
    version 1.1. This indicates 1.1 is currently in our Workbench. We can also 
    see the repository contains 1.2 of file2.txt.&nbsp;The author of 1.2 is Fred. 
    Looks like it's time to ask Fred why he was changing file2.txt.&nbsp; 
    <p>If Fred had entered a meaningful description when releasing his changes,
these descriptions would have appeared in the comment field of the Resource
History view thereby providing us with some insight into the intent of the change.
  </li>
  <li>You can use the four copy buttons to help you 
      merge in conflicting changes made to the repository. 
      <p>
For now we will assume that Fred's change turns out to be the right one.
      <p>Select file2.txt and choose <b>Override and Update</b> from the context menu. 
        When asked to confirm the replacement choose <b>Yes</b>. 
      </li>
  <li>The Update mode no longer has any remaining 
      incoming or conflicting changes.&nbsp; 
      <p>Looking at the status bar we can see there is still one remaining outgoing
change to deal with.</p>
