If you are suspicious of the change you may want to find out some more information
about the change. To do this you first need to figure out who made the change
and why.
<p>In the Navigator select file2.txt and choose Team &gt; Show in Resource
History from the context menu.</p>

      can see there is a * next to version 1.1. This indicates 1.1 is currently 
      in our Workbench. Looking at the right pane of the text compare viewer (above) 
      we can see the repository contains 1.2 of file2.txt.&nbsp; 
      <p>
Looking at the history view again we can see that the author of 1.2 is Fred.
Looks like it's time to ask Fred why he was changing file2.txt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Fred had entered a meaningful description when releasing his changes,
these descriptions would have appeared in the comment field of the Resource
History view thereby providing us with some insight into the intent of the change.
