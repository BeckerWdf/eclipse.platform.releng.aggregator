<h3>The Search view&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Now that the search for &quot;it&quot; has been completed, the Search view 
  is visible. The title of the Search view shows that four matches were found.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <img src="../images/Image51_search_view.gif" alt="Search view. Four occurences of the word it found in the Workspace." border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p CLASS="Head"> Within the Search view two files are shown and within each file 
  there were 2 matches found.&nbsp; </p>

<ol>
  <li>The title of the Search view provides a description of the search just performed. 
    If the view is too narrow to display the full description, hover over the 
    title of the Search view. Observe that hover help appears and provides the 
    full description. 
    <blockquote><img src="../images/Image51_search_hover.gif" alt="Search view. Hover help displaying the full description." border="0"></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Click the Show Next Match button <img src="../images/Image51_search_next.gif" alt="Show next match button" border="0" width="21" height="19"> 
    to navigate to the first match of the search expression (&quot;it&quot;). 
    <br>
    Notice that the file JanesFile.txt is automatically selected and opened in 
    the editor area. <br>
    Click Show Next Match button two more times. Once again the Search view automatically 
    opens the file (JanesText.txt).</li>
  <li>It is sometimes useful to remove uninteresting matches from the search results. 
    The Search view's popup menu provides two ways to remove matches: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Remove Match</b> - Removes the actual match that is currently displayed. 
        If a file contains multiple matches, as in this case, only the current 
        match is removed.</li>
      <li><b>Remove Selected Matches</b> - Removes the file entry and all matches 
        in it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Choose <b>Remove Match</b> from the popup. Notice how JanesText.txt only 
    has one match left.</li>
  <li>Select JanesFile.txt in the Search view.</li>
  <li>Choose <b>Remove Selected Matches</b> from the popup menu. <br>
    The Search view now shows only one match for JanesText.txt 
    <blockquote><img src="../images/Image51_search_reduced.gif" alt="Search view. One occurence in Workspace." border="0"></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Perform a second search for &quot;that&quot; by clicking on the Search button 
    <img src="../images/Image50_search.gif" alt="Search button" border="0"> 
    in the Workbench's toolbar.</li>
  <li>The Search view updates to show the results of the new search. <br>
    Use the drop down button on the Search view's toolbar to move back and forth 
    between the two search results. 
    <blockquote><img src="../images/Image51_search_switching.gif" alt="Search view. Drop down button." border="0"></p></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>In the drop down button choose &quot;it&quot; - 1 Occurrence. The Search 
    view switches back to show the original search. On the context menu choose 
    <b>Search Again</b> to repeat the initial search. Notice that once again there 
    are four matches.</li>
</ol>
