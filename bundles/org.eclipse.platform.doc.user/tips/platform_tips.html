      <p>To use the 'ext' connection method, download and install an SSH command line client 
        for your operating environment. In the <strong> Team &gt; CVS &gt; Ext Connection Method</strong> preference page, configure the location of the SSH executable and how the executable
      is to be called. For the ext method to work the CVS client on your server 
        must support the server mode. You can verify this by running <em>cvs --help-commands</em> 
        and ensure that the server command is supported.</p></td>
