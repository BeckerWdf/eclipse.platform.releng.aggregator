      with fast views</b></td>
    <td width="80%" valign="top" align="left">Use fast views to free up screen real estate while 
    keeping views easily accessible. Clicking on the icon for a fast view
      temporarily reveals it over top of the other views. The fast view retracts
      as soon you click outside of it. The <b>Fast View</b> command in the view's system
      menu toggles whether it is a fast view. You can also create a fast view by dragging
      a view onto the
	shortcut bar at the left.</td>

      synchronization</b></td>
    <td width="80%" valign="top" align="left">The <b>Navigate &gt; Show In</b>
      command provides a uniform way to navigate from an open editor to a view
      showing the corresponding file (e.g., in the resource Navigator view), or
      from a file selected in one view to the same file in a different view (e.g.,

      view is visible, <b>Navigate &gt; Open Resource</b>  (Ctrl+Shift+R) brings 
      up a dialog that allow you to quickly locate and open an editor on any file 
      in the workspace. In the same vein, <b>Navigate &gt; Go To &gt; Resource</b> 
      expands and selects the resource in the Navigator view itself.</td>

    <td width="80%" valign="top" align="left">You can use drag and drop to modify the layout of your editor
      work area.  Grab an editor tab and drag it to the edge of the editor work
      area.  The arrow dock icons 
    (e.g., <img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/drop_left_source.gif"  alt="Left arrow icon">) indicate which way the editor work area will split.

      back arrow

      <p>The resource Navigator view (and similar views) is not tightly linked to the currently open editor by default. This means
      that closing or switching editors does not change the selection in the
      Navigator view. Toggling the <b>Link with

      system). 
    Closed projects require less memory. Also, since they are not examined during builds,

        content compare in the bottom pane.
        <p>
        This works in any context where a file comparison is involved. So if a CVS Synchronize

        SSH connection method called 'extssh'. However this method only supports 
        SSH1 servers. If your server is running SSH2 and you want to use Eclipse 
        to connect to that server you have two options:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>use a command line SSH client that supports SSH2 with the 'ext' connection 
          method</li>
        <li>download a plugin created by <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/eclipse-cvsssh2/">JCraft</a> 
          that provides a SSH2 connection method.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To use the 'ext' connection method, download and install an SSH command line client 
        for your operating environment. In the <strong> Team &gt; CVS &gt; Ext Connection Method</strong> preference page, configure the location of the SSH executable and how the executable
      is to be called. For the ext method to work the CVS client on your server 
        must support the server mode. You can verify this by running <em>cvs --help-commands</em> 
        and ensure that the server command is supported.</p></td>
