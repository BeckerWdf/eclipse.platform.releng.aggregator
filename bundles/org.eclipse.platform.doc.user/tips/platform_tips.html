<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p>[This section should make interesting bathroom reading for an end user of
Eclipse 2.1. It should give them bits of advice on how to use Eclipse
effectively. It should stay away for things that a user would naturally discover
while using Eclipse, and instead focus on high-value things that they might not
have noticed. It also differs in tone from the &quot;New for 2.1&quot; section
in that it deals with anything in 2.1, not just the new stuff. Each item should
stand by itself (as they would have to if we had a &quot;Tip of the Day&quot;
facility).]</p>
<p>[This section needs work. The material here is lifted from the M2 through M5
&quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; bulletins. Some of the items might make good Tips
and Tricks.]</p>

      notify the CVS server whenever you start to edit a file. In turn, the CVS
      server will notify others on the watch list for that file. When you go to
      edit a file, you are warned if there are others editing the same file. <b>Team
