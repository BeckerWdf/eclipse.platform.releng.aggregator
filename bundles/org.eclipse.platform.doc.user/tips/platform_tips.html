<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p>[This section should make interesting bathroom reading for an end user of
Eclipse 2.1. It should give them bits of advice on how to use Eclipse
effectively. It should stay away for things that a user would naturally discover
while using Eclipse, and instead focus on high-value things that they might not
have noticed. It also differs in tone from the &quot;New for 2.1&quot; section
in that it deals with anything in 2.1, not just the new stuff. Each item should
stand by itself (as they would have to if we had a &quot;Tip of the Day&quot;
facility).]</p>
<p>[This section needs work. The material here is lifted from the M2 through M5
&quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; bulletins. Some of the items might make good Tips
and Tricks.]</p>

      showing the corresponding file (e.g., in the resource Navigator view), or

    <td width="70%" valign="top" align="left">The &quot;edit&quot; portion of
      CVS Watch/Edit is now supported within Eclipse. Through settings on the <b>Team
      / CVS / Watch/Edit</b> preference page (which must be set before the
      projects are added to your workspace), you can choose to automatically
      notify the CVS server whenever you start to edit a file. In turn, the CVS
      server will notify others on the watch list for that file. When you go to
      edit a file, you are warned if there are others editing the same file. <b>Team
      &gt; Show Editors</b> on a file's context menu lists everyone currently
      working on the file. There are also <b>Team &gt; Edit</b> and <b>Unedit</b>
      actions.</td>

      item by dragging the item from a view like the Navigator or Package
      Explorer and dropping it over the editor area.&nbsp;
      <p>Views can support this by providing a ResourceTransfer, a
      MarkerTransfer or an EditorInputTransfer in their drag source event
      handler. See the documentation for these classes under Platform Plug-in
      Developer Guide / API Reference / Workbench / org.eclipse.ui.part.</p>

    <td width="70%" valign="top" align="left">The output from Ant builds is now
      written to the <b>Console</b> view in the same hierarchical format seen
      when running Ant from the command line. Ant tasks (for example &quot;[mkdir]&quot;)
      are hyperlinked to the associated Ant build file, and javac error reports
      are hyperlinked to the associated Java source file and line number.
      (Currently, error linking only works for errors reported by the Eclipse
      Java compiler; other javac error output formats will be added for M5).
      <p>The Console now supports hyperlinks for javac and jikes as well as the
      Eclipse Java compiler. All such error reports are hyperlinked to the

      advanced search filtering. Working sets are persisted from one Eclipse
      session to the next, and can be used in workbench help searches or from
      the Help browser. They allow narrowing searches down as far as a section
      of a book.

      away, you can hit&nbsp; ALT+LeftArrow (Navigate &gt; Backward, or the back

      editors does not change the selection in the Navigator view. Use the <b>Sync

      changes. And CVS projects can now be configured to not fetch absent
