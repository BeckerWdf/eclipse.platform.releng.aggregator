<H1 CLASS="Head"> Tips and Tricks for using CVS in Eclipse</H1>
<p>If the answer to your question is not here, read the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-vcm-home/docs/online/cvs_features2.0/cvs-faq.html">CVS 
  FAQ</a>. </p>
<h3 CLASS="Head">Sharing your CVS lineup with others</h3>
<p CLASS="Head">You can save the list of projects shared with CVS into a team 
  project set. This provides an easy way of re-creating your workspace with shared 
  CVS projects. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Once you have checked out the set of projects from the CVS repository, select 
    <strong>File &gt; Export</strong> from the main menu.</li>
  <li> Select <strong>Team Project Set</strong> from the list and then select 
    the projects to be exported. The generated file can be shared with your team 
    to allow quick setups of your development environment. </li>
  <li>To import the project set select <strong>File &gt; Import</strong> and select 
    <strong>Team Project Set</strong>. The projects will be checked out of CVS 
    and a repository location will automatically be created.</li>
</ol>

<h3 CLASS="Head">How to use an SSH2 server with CVS</h3>
<p CLASS="Head">Eclipse comes with a built-in SSH connection method called 'extssh'. 
  However this method only supports SSH1 servers. If your server is running SSH2 
  and you want to use Eclipse to connect to that server you have two options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>use a command line SSH client that supports SSH2 with the 'ext' connection 
    method</li>
  <li>download a plugin created by <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/eclipse-cvsssh2/">JCraft</a> 
    that provides a SSH2 connection method.</li>
</ol>
<p>To use the 'ext' connection method download an SSH command line client for 
  your platform and in the CVS preference page, <strong>Windows &gt; Preferences 
  then Team &gt; CVS &gt; Ext Connection Method</strong> you can configure the 
  location of the SSH executable and how the executable will be called. For the 
  ext method to work the CVS client on your server must support the server mode. 
  You can verify this by running <em>cvs --help-commands</em> and ensure that 
  the server command is supported.</p>


<h3 CLASS="Head">Quick Sync Action</h3>
<p CLASS="Head">A new &quot;quick sync&quot; action has been added to the CVS 
  action set. The action lets you select which CVS projects to synchronize. A 
  new button shows up in the CVS repository view, but you can customize your workbench 
  toolbar to place it within easy reach. You can add the action to a key binding 
  and quickly synchronize projects via the keyboard. </p>
<ol>
  <li> From the CVS Repository Exploring perspective select the <img src="../images/cvs_synch.gif" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle"> 
    <strong>Synchronize CVS projects</strong> button. </li>
  <li>Select to either include all projects that are shared with CVS or specify 
    a working set. Then select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
  <li>The Synchronize view will open.</li>
</ol>
<p> Note: The synchronize action is not enabled by default in other non-CVS specific 
  perspectives. You can enable the action to appear in your current perspective 
  by selecting <strong>Window &gt; Customize Perspective</strong>. Then enable 
  the CVS item via <strong>Other > CVS</strong>.</p>
<h3 CLASS="Head">Synchronize view that contains many conflicts</h3>
<p CLASS="Head">It can happen that a project is synchronized with a repository 
  but somehow the CVS meta information was either deleted or not available. For 
  example, by running <strong>Team &gt; Disconnect</strong> and deleting the meta 
  information then trying to shared the project again. By default the synchronize 
  view uses CVS revision numbers to calculate the sync state for files. However 
  if the sync state is wrong or is not available you can revert to using file 
  contents for calculating the sync state.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Your sync view contains many <em>false</em> conflicts (e.g. file that are 
    marked as conflicting but whose contents are actually the same).</li>
  <li>From the view's toolbar menu select <strong>Compare File Contents</strong>.</li>
  <li>The synchronization will be refreshed and all false conflicts will be removed.</li>
  <li>For any remaining real conflicts you can either accept the remote contents 
    <strong>Override and Update</strong> or release your file to the server <strong>Override 
    and Commit</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 CLASS="Head">Revert a single file that was edited, but not committed</h3>
<p CLASS="Head">There are a two ways of doing this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the file and from the context menu select Replace With &gt; Latest 
    from HEAD.</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the file or a parent folder and from the context menu select <strong>Team 
    &gt; Synchronize with Repository</strong>.</li>
  <li>Next switch to incoming/outgoing mode using the toolbar button in the view.</li>
  <li>Select the file and from the context menu select <strong>Override and Update</strong>.</li>
</ol>
