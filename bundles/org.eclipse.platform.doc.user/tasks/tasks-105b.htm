<H1>Reverting a branch to a previous version</H1>
<p>
It is often useful to revert the contents of a branch to those of a specific version. For example, if your current branch contains changes that you no longer want to release you can revert all or a portion of a project to the contents of any version.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Checkout into your workspace the contents from the branch that you want 
    to revert. </li>
  <li>Select <strong>Compare With &gt; Another Branch or Version</strong> on the 
    resource(s) that you want to revert. </li>
  <li>From the tag selection dialog box select the version to which you want to 
    revert the branch.</li>
  <li>When the compare editor opens, review the differences that are shown and 
    ensure that they are what you expected. </li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Tip</i>: If several files report as false differences (e.g. the files are 
  shown but there are no actual changes in the files) select the <img src="../images/team_contents_icon.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
  <strong>Use File Contents</strong> toolbar button to recomputed the comparison 
  using file contents instead of revision numbers.<br>
  <br>
  <li>Select the root folder in the compare view and from the context menu select 
    <strong>Copy All Changes From Right To Left</strong>. After the operation 
    is completed the folder or project you compared against will have exactly 
    the same contents as the remote revision. </li>
  <li>You can verify this by performing another comparison against the version. 
    However this time, when the comparison completes select the <img src="../images/team_contents_icon.gif" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle"> 
    <strong>Use File Contents</strong> toolbar button to redo the comparison using 
    file contents instead of revision numbers. <i>Note</i>: you may also have 
    to select the <strong>Ignore White Space</strong> button too. </li>
  <li>After the comparison using file contents completes the compare editor should 
    be empty. Meaning that the files in your workspace are identical to the ones 
    in the selected version.</li>
</ol>
<p CLASS="Head">Once your workspace contains the new contents, run your tests 
  then commit the changes to the branch.</p>
