<H1>Installing several features at once using group updates</H1>

<p>To install several features at once using update manager (ordinarily requires web 
  access):
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the main update manager by clicking <b>Help &gt; Software Updates &gt;
    Update Manager</b>. This opens the Install/Update perspective.</li>
  <li>Create a bookmark for a web site where Eclipse features and plug-ins are
    published. In the Feature Updates view, select <b>New
    &gt; Site Bookmark</b> from the context menu.</li>
  <li>In the New Site Bookmark dialog that opens, give the site a name such as 
    &quot;CompanyA&quot; and enter the URL such as
	&quot;http://companyA.example.com/eclipseupdates&quot;.</li>
  <li>Expand the newly created item in Feature Updates view to show the
    categories of feature versions available at that update site. This will
    contact the web site to discover what features are available.</li>
  <li>Expand one of the top-level categories and select a feature. Information
    about that feature appears in the Preview view.</li>
  <li>After selecting the feature to be added, locate section in the Preview
    view with a title <b>Group Updates</b> and check the &quot;Install by adding
    to the Selected Updates&quot; checkbox.</li>
  <li>Repeat for every feature you want to install. At any point, you can
    inspect the selection by pressing &quot;Selected Updates&quot; hyperlink to
    the right of the checkbox, or by bringing the Selected Updates view to the
    top (by default, it is stacked with the Install Configuration view).</li>
  <li>When all the features that are to be installed are selected, switch to the
    Selected Updates view, bring up the pop-up menu and select <b>Process All</b>
    item. If you change your mind about any feature, you can remove it from the
    list prior to processing.</li>
  <li>The Feature Install wizard confirms the details of the features you are
    about to install. Note that there may be conflicts between features you have
    selected. You will be informed about them and asked to deselect the ones
    causing the conflict. Click <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>Carefully review the license agreements for the upgraded features. If the
    terms of all these licenses are acceptable, check &quot;I accept the terms
    in the license agreements&quot;. Do not proceed to download the features if
    the license terms are not acceptable.</li>
  <li>If one or more features selected for install include optional features, a
    page will show up allowing you to select whether you want them installed or
    not. Optional features typically carry functionality that is not essential
    for proper functioning of the main feature.</li>
  <li>The Install Location page controls where the new feature's files are to be
    installed on the local computer. Select the directory into which the product
    is installed and hit <b>Next</b>. (If the product is installed in a
    directory to which you do not have write access, you should contact your
    system administrator and get them to install this feature so that it will be
    generally available. The other option is to click <b>Add</b> and point to a
    directory to which you do have write access; however, features installed
    there are only available when using the current workspace.)</li>
  <li>Feature versions can be digitally signed by the company that provides
    them. This allows you to verify more easily that the features and
    plug-ins that are about to be downloaded and installed are coming from a
    trusted supplier.</p><br> <b>Warning:</b> Because of the possibility of harmful or even
    malicious plug-ins, you should only download features from parties that
    you trust.</p><br> <p>Click <b>Install</b> to allow the downloading and installing
    to proceed.</p></li>
  <li>Once the new feature and plug-ins have been downloaded successfully and
    their files installed into the product on the local computer, a new
    configuration that incorporates these features and plug-ins will be
    formulated. Click <b>Yes</b> when asked to exit and restart the workbench for the
    changes to take effect. To add other new features at the same time before
    restarting, click <b>No</b> and repeat.</li>
