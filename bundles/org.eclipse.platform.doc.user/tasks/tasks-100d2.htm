Filtering resources from a release by adding a CVS ignore file</H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>When synchronizing resources, often there are resources that you do not want to release to the stream.
You can use the CVS &quot;ignore&quot; facility, which reads the contents of
the file .cvsignore to determine what to ignore. (This facility is used most often to
ignore directories. By contrast, the global facility that is also provided with
the workbench causes all files whose names match specified patterns to be
ignored at release time, regardless of the directory that they are in.) Any file or subdirectory <i> in the current directory</i> that matches any one of the patterns
will be ignored.</P>
<P> The&nbsp; <i>.</i>cvsignore file can be added to any directory
of a project. Many existing CVS projects
already contain several of these files.
This text file consists of a list of files, directories, or patterns. </P>
<P> For example, to add a .cvsignore file to ignore the entire bin directory of
an existing project: </P>
<ol>
  <li>In the Navigator view, select a project that contains a /bin directory. The bin
directory will commonly contain the projects build output; these are files that
are generated from the project's source files and are usually not version-controlled.</li>
  <li>From the pop-up menu for the project, select <b> New &gt; File</b>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Type <i>.</i><samp>cvsignore</samp> as the file name, then
press <b>Finish</b>. The file will be created in your project's root
directory. You should see it in the Navigator view.</li>
  <li>
Enter <samp>bin</samp>  in the .cvsignore file and save
it.</li>
  <li>
Select the project.&nbsp; From the context menu, select the <b> Team &gt;
Synchronize with Stream</b> menu item.&nbsp; Notice that the bin
directory does not show as an outgoing change. It is ignored.</li>
</ol>
<P>The cvsignore file consists of a list of files, directories, or patterns.&nbsp; In a similar way
to the global ignore facility, the wildcards * and ? may be present in any entry in the
.cvsignore
file.&nbsp; Any file or subdirectory <i> in the current directory </i> that matches any one of the patterns
will be ignored.
