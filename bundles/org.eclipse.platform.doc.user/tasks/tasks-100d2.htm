<H1 CLASS="Head">Authoring the CVS .cvsignore file</H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>When committing resources, often there are resources 
  that you do not want to add to version control. One way you can do this is by 
  using the CVS &quot;ignore&quot; facility, which reads the contents of the file 
  <i>.cvsignore</i> to determine what to ignore. This facility is used most often 
  to ignore directories. </P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>The <i>.cvsignore</i> file can be added to any directory 
  of a project. Many existing CVS projects already contain several of these files. 
  This text file consists of a list of files, directories, or patterns. </P>
<P> For example, to add a .cvsignore file to ignore the entire bin directory of
an existing project: </P>
<ol>
  <li>In the Navigator view, select a project that contains a /bin directory. The bin
directory will commonly contain the projects build output; these are files that
are generated from the project's source files and are usually not version-controlled.</li>
  <li>From the pop-up menu for the project, select <b> New &gt; File</b>.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Type <i>.</i><samp>cvsignore</samp> as the file name, then
press <b>Finish</b>. The file will be created in your project's root
directory. You should see it in the Navigator view.</li>
  <li>
Enter <samp>bin</samp>  in the .cvsignore file and save
it.</li>
  <li> Select the project.&nbsp; From the context menu, select the <b> Team &gt; 
    Synchronize with Repository</b> menu item.&nbsp; Notice that the bin directory 
    does not show as an outgoing change. It is ignored.</li>
</ol>
<P>The cvsignore file consists of a list of files, directories, or patterns.&nbsp; In a similar way
to the global ignore facility, the wildcards * and ? may be present in any entry in the
.cvsignore
file.&nbsp; Any file or subdirectory <i> in the current directory </i> that matches any one of the patterns
will be ignored.
</P>
