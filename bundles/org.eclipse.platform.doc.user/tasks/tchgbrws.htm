<h1>Changing the web browser used by the help system</h1>

<p>The help system uses browser adapters to display online documentation in an
   embedded web browser or an external browser you have installed on your
   system.</p>
<p>If embedded web browser is supported on your system, help uses an embedded
  help browser to display help, whenever possible. When a
  modal window is showing on the screen, that would prevent interacting with
  the embedded browser, requesting help opens an external browser. If embedded
  browser is used on your system and you prefer to always use external browser,
  you select this behavior in help preferences. Similarly, if you have more than
  one supported adapter and browser, you can select which adapter you want the help 
  system to use. To change the web browser adapter setting: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select <b>Window &gt; Preferences</b> to open the Preferences notebook.</li>
  <li>Select <b>Help</b>.</li>
  <li>If embedded help browser is supported on your system, but you prefer
    to use external one, select <strong>Always use external browsers</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Current web browser adapter</b> box, select the desired adapter.
    If only one  external adapter appears, it cannot be changed.</li>
</ol>

<p>If your system does not have any of the supported browser adapters installed,
   you may only see <b>Custom browser</b> in the Preferences. In that case, specify
   a path to the browser program that launches your browser.
   If the program is available on your system path, you may specify only the program
   name.
   If the program does not accept URL as its last parameter, you may use <i>%1</i> string
   to denote the position of the URL parameter in the command.
