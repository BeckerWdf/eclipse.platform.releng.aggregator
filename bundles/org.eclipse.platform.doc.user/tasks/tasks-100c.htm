Filtering resources from a release</H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>In some case, you may not want to release all resources in
a project to the repository.&nbsp;
For example, external editors might create temporary files in your project, or compilation of .java files
might create .class files, or some build operations might result in binary files. These
generated files, when taken together, may
be quite large.&nbsp; In addition, they may be regenerated whenever a build is performed,
resulting in many&nbsp; outgoing changes.  Typically these are not files that one wants to persist in the
repository or to share with other members of a team. &nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>The following mechanisms are available for specifying which resources
should not be released to a repository:&nbsp;</P>
