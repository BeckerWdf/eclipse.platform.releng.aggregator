<H1 CLASS="Head">Stopping resources from releasing at synchronization time</H1>
<p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">If you place resources under version control by
synchronizing them without first defining &quot;ignore&quot; criteria, you may
notice that certain files (for example bin/*.obj and *.ba~) appear in the
Synchronize view as outgoing additions. You probably do not want these files to be synchronized.
You can still ignore these files, despite the fact that the workbench already
considers them to be under version control. You first have to delete the files
that you want ignored. (This is usually is not a problem since ignored files are
either temporary or build results of your important files, the source). Then add
the ignore pattern using either the global or CVS ignore mechanism.&nbsp; At
this point you can rebuild your project and synchronize your project with the
stream.</p>
<p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">Here is how you can ignore files once
they already appear as outgoing additions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">
From the Navigator view, delete the /bin directory and all the *.ba~
    files.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">
Create a <i> .</i>cvsignore file (<b>File &gt; New &gt; File</b>) in the parent directory of
    /bin, and add <samp>bin</samp> to the file.&nbsp; Save the <i> .</i>cvsignore file.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">Select <b>Workbench &gt; Preferences &gt;
Team &gt; Ignored Resources</b> and add <samp>*.ba~</samp> to the list of
    patterns to be ignored.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">Select the <b> Project &gt; Rebuild
All</b> to rebuild the project.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">In the pop-up menu of the Navigator view, select
    <b> Team
    &gt; Synchronize</b> with Stream to synchronize with the stream. The /bin directory and the
    *.ba~ files no longer appear as outgoing additions. The <i> .</i>cvsignore file should be released to the
    stream so that others in your team can share this setting.</li>
</ol>
