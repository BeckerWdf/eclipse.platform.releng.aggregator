This opens the update manager perspective.</li>  <li>Create a bookmark for a web site where Eclipse features and plug-ins are    published. In the Feature Updates view, use the view's context menu <b>New    &gt; Site Bookmark</b>.</li>  <li>In the New Site Bookmark dialog that opens, give the site a name such as     &quot;CompanyA&quot; and enter the URL such as	&quot;http://com.example.companyA/eclipseupdates&quot;.</li>  <li>Expand the newly created item in Feature Updates view to show the    categories of feature versions available at that update site. This will    contact the web site to discover what features are available.</li>  <li>Expand one of the top-level categories and select a feature. Information    about that feature appears in the Preview view.</li>  <li>After selecting the feature to be added, click the <b>Install</b> button    within the Preview view.</li>  <li>The Feature Install wizard confirms the details of the feature you are    about to install. Click <b>Next</b>.</li>  <li>Carefully review the license agreements for the upgraded features. If the    terms of all these licenses are acceptable, check &quot;I accept the terms    in the license agreements&quot;. Do not proceed to download the features if    the license terms are not acceptable.</li>  <li>The Install Location page controls where the new feature's files are to be    installed on the local computer. Select the directory into which the product    is installed and hit <b>Next</b>. (If the product is installed in a    directory to which you do not have write access, you should contact your    system administrator and get them to install this feature so that it will be    generally available. The other option is to click <b>Add</b> and point to a    directory to which you do have write access; however, feature installed    there are only available when using the current workspace.)</li>  <li>Feature versions can be digitally signed by the company that provides    them. This allows the user to verify more easily that the features and    plug-ins that are about to be downloaded and installed are coming from a    trusted supplier. <em>Warning: Because of the possibility of harmful or even    malicious plug-ins, users should only download features from parties that    they trust</em>. Click <b>Install</b> to allow the downloading and installing    to proceed.</li>  <li>Once the new feature and plug-ins have been downloaded successfully and    their files installed into the product on the local computer, a new    configuration that incorporates these features and plug-ins will be    formulated. Click <b>Yes</b> when asked to exit and restart the workbench for the    changes to take effect. To add other new features at the same time before    restarting, click <b>No</b> and repeat.</li></ol><P><img border="0" src="../images/ngrelc.gif" alt="Related concepts" width="159" height="27"><br><a href="../concepts/concepts-25.htm">Features</a></P><P><img border="0" src="../images/ngrelt.gif" alt="Related tasks" width="159" height="27"><br><a href="tasks-33.htm">Inspecting the current configuration</a><br><a href="tasks-36.htm">Updating Eclipse with the update manager</a><br><a href="tasks-37.htm">Saving a configuration</a><br><a href="tasks-38.htm">Restoring a saved configuration</a></P><p>&nbsp;<br><a href="../hglegal2002.htm"><img src = "../images/ngibmcpy2002.gif" alt="Copyright IBM Corporation and others 2000, 2002" border="0"></a></p></BODY></HTML>
