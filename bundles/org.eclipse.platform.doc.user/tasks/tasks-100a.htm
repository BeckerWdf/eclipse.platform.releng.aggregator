  <h1>Branching</h1>
  <p>Creating a branch and releasing resources to that branch is useful in cases where you are not yet ready to put
  your changes in the main development flow. It is also useful for creating incremental patches to existing
  versions.</p>
  <p>To create a branch:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>From the context menu of the project, select <b>Team &gt; Branch</b>.
      <p><img src="../images/cvs_new_branch.png" alt="Create a new CVS Branch dialog" border="0"></p>
    </li>
    <li>Enter the Branch Name for the new branch in the text area.</li>
    <li>A default version tag name will be proposed by the dialog. If you do not like the suggested name, you can
    change it in the text area.</li>
    <li>If you would like to start working in the branch immediately, make sure the checkbox is selected.</li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Note:</em> The Version Name is important; you will need this when you want to merge your changes later on. It
  identifies the point at which the branch was created.</p>
