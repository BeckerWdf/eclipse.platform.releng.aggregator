Splitting from a stream</H1>
<P CLASS="Para">
Typically, you will want to split a stream under the following conditions: </P>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para">To fix a bug in an old version of a project</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para">To store project variants or private work in a
    separate stream</li>
</ul>
<p CLASS="Para"> When splitting a stream you always split at a predefined point in
time. This is called the <i>initial state</i> of the new stream. When you split
a stream, the initial state is always a version.&nbsp;
</p>
<p CLASS="Para">Generally, you will split a stream with the intention of
eventually merging the changes back into the originating stream.
</p>
<p CLASS="Para"> There are two options for splitting a stream.
</p>
<h2> Option 1: Splitting based on a project version
</h2>
<p>
Choose this option if you are splitting based on an existing project
version.&nbsp; This is often done to fix a bug in a previous
version of your project. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Switch to the Team perspective or add the Repositories view to the current
    perspective.</li>
  <li>
From the pop-up menu for the Repositories view, select New &gt; Stream.. The New
    Stream wizard opens.</li>
  <li>Select the repository that contains the stream you
want to split.</li>
  <li>Enter a name for the new stream and click <b>Finish</b> to close the
    wizard.</li>
  <li>Add a project version to the new stream to set the initial state of the
    stream. To do this, select the new stream in the Repositories view and
    select <b>Copy Version to Stream</b> from its pop-up menu. The Choose
    Versions window opens.</li>
  <li> Select the projects
and their versions that you wish to copy to the stream.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
Expand the new stream to see the projects. You will see the resources that are in the project version
    that you added to the stream.</li>
  <li>Select the project that you want to add to the workbench.&nbsp; From its
    pop-up menu, select <b> Add to Workspace</b>.&nbsp; Changes released
from the project will now go to the new stream.</li>
</ol>
<p> If you enable <b> Show Version Info</b> via the drop-down menu in
the Navigator view's toolbar, you will see the new stream name shown to the right of
the project.</p>
<h2>
Option 2: Splitting with changes in your workspace </h2>
<P> In some cases you may not want to release your changes to
everyone in the team, but would still like to version them. You may want to do
this if your changes are not stable yet or if it will take a long time before you
are ready to release them to the team.
In this case you will want to create a new stream for releasing your changes. </P>
<ol>
  <li>Create a version of your project from the
workspace to capture the state before you made any changes.&nbsp; This
version will contain the base versions of the project's resources.&nbsp; The
changes you have made from the base versions will later be released to the new
stream.
    <p>Right-click your project in the Navigator view and select <b>Version from
    Workspace</b> from its pop-up menu.</li>
  <li>
Complete the Version Selected Resources page. (Versioning is covered in a
    different topic in this documentation.)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>When prompted, review the outgoing changes listed in the details
window.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Switch to the Team perspective or add the Repositories view to the current
    perspective. Right-click in the Repositories view and select <b> New &gt;
    Stream</b> from the pop-up menu to create a new stream. The New Stream
    wizard opens.</li>
  <li>Select the repository that contains the stream you want to split.</li>
  <li>Enter a name ofr the new stream and click <b>Finish</b> to close the
    wizard.</li>
  <li>Add the project version to the new stream to set the initial state of the
    stream. To do this, select the new stream in the Repositories view, select <b>Copy
    Version to Stream</b> from its pop-up menu, and in the Choose Versions
    window select the project and version that you created earlier.</li>
  <li>In the Navigator view, select the project and select <b>Properties</b>
    from its pop-up menu to change sharing of the project to the new stream.</li>
  <li>Synchronize the project with the new stream. Your changes will appear as
    outgoing to the new stream. Release them into the new stream.</li>
</ol>
