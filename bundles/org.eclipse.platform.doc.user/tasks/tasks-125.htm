<H1>Using the Available Updates wizard</H1>
<p>The <b>Available Updates</b> wizard shows you what updates are available for your software.
This wizard is shown if you click the automatic updates notification popup, or if you
checked for updates in the <b>Installed Software</b> page.  To update your system:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the software item versions that you wish to upgrade.  You may check and 
  uncheck different items in the list.  Each time you do, the compatibility of the
  checked updates with your current system will be recomputed.</li>
  <li>If the selected items have license agreements to be reviewed, you must click <b>Next</b>.  
    Carefully review the license agreements for the upgraded items. If the 
    terms of all these licenses are acceptable, check &quot;I accept the terms 
    in the license agreements.&quot; Do not proceed to download the features if 
    the license terms are not acceptable.</li>
  <li>If the license agreements are acceptable, or if the selected items did not have 
  license agreements to review, click <b>Finish</b>.  This will begin the download and
  installation of the updated software.</li>  
  <li><p>Some of the items may be digitally signed by the company that provides them. 
    This allows you to verify more easily that the features and plug-ins 
    that are about to be downloaded and installed are coming from a trusted supplier. You
    may be prompted to verify digitally signed content once the signature is
    detected.</p><br>
    <p><b>Warning:</b> Because of the possibility of harmful or even malicious software, 
    you should only download software from parties that you trust.</li>
  <li>Once all of the software is downloaded successfully and the necessary
    files installed into the product on the local computer, you will be prompted
    to restart for the Workbench.  Click <b>Yes</b> 
    when asked to exit and restart the Workbench for the changes to take effect.</li>
