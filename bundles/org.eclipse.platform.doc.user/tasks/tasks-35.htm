<H1>Picking up pending changes</H1>

<p>Whenever the Eclipse platform is started it detects and notes any changes that 
  have been made to the installed base of files such as the appearance (or disappearance) 
  of feature and plug-in versions. New or updated features are not automatically 
  configured for an existing workspace; rather, you are told on start up that 
  there are updates and given the opportunity to configure them. If you accept them, 
  the new and updated feature versions become a part of the feature and plug-in 
  configuration used for that workspace. If not accepted, the new and updated 
  feature versions remain dormant (disabled) for that workspace, but available 
  to be picked up at a later time.
</p>
<p>To pick up pending changes:
<ol>
  <li>When new changes are detected, Configuration Changes page will open on
    startup. Alternatively, click <b>Help &gt; Software Updates &gt; Pending
    Changes...</b>.
    The Configuration Changes page opens showing a list of detected changes.</li>
  <li>Select and expand detected change items to see the associated feature
    versions. You can accept the entire change items, or select individual
    features. Individual selection may be necessary in case when some of the new
    features have errors.</li>
  <li>Check items that are to be included in the configuration. Unchecked items
    are ignored (but remain pending).</li>
  <li>Click <b>Finish</b>  to update the configuration, or <b>Cancel</b> to
    retain the current configuration (pending changes remain pending). Note that
    if a pending item has been partially selected (not all the features),
    pressing <b>Finish</b> will mark the item processed and it will be removed
    from the list of pending changes.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Yes</b> when asked to exit and restart the workbench for the
    changes to take effect.</li>
</ol>
