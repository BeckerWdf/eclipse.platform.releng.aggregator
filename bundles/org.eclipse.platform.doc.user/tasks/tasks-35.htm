<H1>Picking up pending changes</H1>

<p>Whenever the Eclipse
platform is started it detects and notes any changes that have been made to the installed base of files
such as the appearance (or disappearance) of
feature and plug-in versions. New or updated features are not automatically configured
for an existing workspace; rather, the user is told on start up that there are
updates and given the opportunity to configure them. If accepted, the new and
updated feature versions become a part of the feature and plug-in configuration
used for that workspace. If not accepted, the new and updated feature versions
remain dormant (disabled) for that workspace, but available to be picked up at a later
time.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click <b>Yes</b> when informed of updates and prompted to enter the update
    manager. Or click <b>Help</b> &gt; <b>Software Updates</b> &gt; <b>Pending
    Changes</b>.<br>
    The Configuration Changes page opens showing a list of detected changes.</li>
  <li>Select and expand detected change items to see the associated feature
    versions.</li>
  <li>Check items that are to be included in the configuration. Unchecked items
    are ignored (but remain pending).</li>
  <li>Click <b>Finish</b>  to update the configuration, or <b>Cancel</b> to
    retain the current configuration (pending changes remain pending).</li>
  <li>Click <b>Yes</b> when asked to exit and restart the workbench for the
    changes to take effect.</li>
</ol>
