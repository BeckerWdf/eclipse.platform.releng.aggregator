  <h1>Sharing a new project using CVS</h1>
  <p>There are several scenarios that can occur when sharing a project using CVS. The most common scenario is sharing a
  new project using CVS when the project does not already exist remotely.</p>
  <p>To share a new project using CVS:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In one of the navigation views, select the project to be shared.</li>
    <li>Select <b>Team &gt;</b> <b>Share Project...</b> from the project's pop-up menu. The Share Project wizard
    opens.</li>
    <li>From the list of available repository providers, choose <b>CVS</b> and click <b>Next</b> to go to the next
    page. (<b>Note</b>: If CVS is not present in the list, it may be disabled. Clicking on the <strong>Show All
    Wizards</strong> button should make it visible. Also note that if there is only repository provider registered for
    your workspace, you will automatically bypass this step entirely.)</li>
    <li>Select the target repository from the list of known repositories or, if the target repository is not in this
    list, choose to create a new repository location and click <b>Next</b>.</li>
    <li>If entering a new repository location, enter the repository information and click <b>Next</b> when completed.
    (<b>Note</b>: this page is the same format as the <a href="tasks-92.htm">Creating a CVS repository location</a>
    wizard.)</li>
    <li>Either choose to use the name of the local project as the remote project name or enter another name and click
    <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    <li>The final page shows you the resources of the new project as outgoing additions. You can choose to commit or
    ignore resources from this page. (<b>Note</b>: If the project already exists remotely, the page will show conflicts
    on any files that exist both locally and remotely. Only those files whose contents do not match are shown.)</li>
    <li>Click <b>Finish</b> to share the project with the repository. You will be prompted to commit any resources in
    the new project that have not yet been committed or ignored. Choosing to do so will run the commit operation in the
    background.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>Consequences for Linked Resources</h4>
  <p>As mentioned in <a href="../concepts/concepts-13.htm">Linked resources</a>, different providers may handle linked
  resources differently. For Team CVS, linked resources are allowed but ignored. Specifically, projects which contain
  linked resources can be shared with CVS, but the linked resources themselves cannot be version controlled.</p>
