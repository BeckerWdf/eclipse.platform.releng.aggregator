<h1 class="Head">Determining who last modified a line with the Annotate command</h1>
<p>Let's say you have found some code that you don't understand on line 65 of a file. 
  Who do you ask about it?  Well you could start by 
  looking at the resource history for the file, but that won't tell you who changed 
  that particular line. This is why the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Annotate</span> command is useful. 
  Sometimes jokingly referred to as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">blame</span>, 
  it allows you to pick any 
  ASCII file (see note on binary files) and get a listing of who changed what 
  line. </p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Show Annotation</span> action
is
available form the following places: History View, Repository Explorer,
Synchronize View, and the Resource and Packages View. There are two available
'flavors' of Annotate: the newer Quick Diff Annotate and the older Annotate View. You
can select which version of annotate you wish to use from the CVS Annotate preference page.
To summarize the differences between the two types of annotate:

<ol>
<li><b>Quick Diff Annotate</b>: <ul>
<li>Quick Diff Annotate displays the annotations on a local file right in the same editor.</li>
<li>Clicking on an annotation or clicking on any line in the editor will prompt the History View to show the corresponding revision information.</li>
<li>Doesn't lose your place in the editor when displaying the annotation; simply adds the annotations to the annotation bar of the editor
that you are currently using.</li>
<li>To turn off annotations, you have to select 'Hide Revision Information' from the annotation bar
context menu.</li></ul>
<br></li>

<li><b>Annotate View</b>:<ul>
<li>Perspective may switch, depending on your preference settings.</li>
<li>A read-only text editor is opened to display the annotations.</li>
<li>Selecting changes in the Annotate View will highlight the lines 
associated with the selected change in the text editor.</li>
<li>Conversely, selecting a line in the editor will cause the Annotate view to
select the change associated with that line. </li>
<li>The History View will show the history for the opened file and
highlight the revision of the currently selected change. This allow you
to quickly see the commit comment for a particular change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h2>Only works with text files</h2>
<p>The annotate command will only work with files that are marked as ASCII in 
  the CVS repository. Also, the command will open a text file to show the changes 
  even if the associated editor in the workbench is a non-text editor. For example, 
  if you run annotate on a plugin.xml file a simple text editor will be opened 
  instead of the full PDE editor.</p>
