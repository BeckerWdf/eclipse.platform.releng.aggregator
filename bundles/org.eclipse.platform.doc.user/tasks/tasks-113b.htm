Resolving conflicts </H1>
<DIV CLASS="Topic">
  <P CLASS="Para"> When updating or committing you may encounter conflicts.&nbsp; 
    A conflict occurs when you have locally modified a resource for which a more 
    recent revision is available in the branch in the repository.  Specifically, the branch 
    will contain a revision newer than the base revision of your resource. In 
    this situation you can choose to do one of the following:</P>
<ul>
  <li>
      <p CLASS="Para">You can take the change from the branch, discarding your 
        local work. This could occur if you have made unintended changes locally, 
        or if you realize that the revision in the repository is better than yours. 
        Overwriting your local changes should be done with caution since you are 
        in essence throwing work out.
    </li>
  <li>
      <p CLASS="Para">You can commit your change, subsuming the revision in 
        the repository. This should be done with great caution since you are in essence 
        throwing away someone else's work.  In particular, the change you 
        are overwriting may have other dependencies in the branch (for example 
        there may be other incoming changes which depend on the conflict).
    </li>
  <li>
      <p CLASS="Para">You can merge your work and the repository resource, saving 
        locally the merged resource. You may then later choose to commit this 
        merged result.
    </li>
</ul>
<P CLASS="Para">
Typically, you will want to take the third option, that is to merge, because of the loss of work issues
with the other two choices.</P>
  <h2> <a name="MergingChanges">Manually Merging Changes</a></h2>
  <P CLASS="Para">The Synchronize View indicates those resources which are in 
    conflict with the branch. For a given resource in conflict, typically you 
    will want to merge your changes with changes in the branch's resource.</P>
  <P CLASS="Para">For example, let us assume that both you and another team member 
    have modified the same html page.&nbsp; Selecting that resource in the Synchronize 
    view will display a comparison of the local resource and the branch revision.  By
    cycling through and merging the individual changes, you can decide for 
    each change whether to accept the incoming change, reject it, or merge it 
    with your local changes.&nbsp; When you are finished merging, you save your 
    changes. This overwrites your local resource with the result of the merge.&nbsp; 
    You can subsequently commit this merged resource.</P>
  <P CLASS="Para"><b>Tip:</b> When merging changes, it is often convenient to be able to distinguish 
    which files you have completed merging. When you're done merging a file, you 
    can pick <b>Mark as Merged</b> from the context menu. This will change the 
    status of the file from being a conflict to being an outgoing change.</P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> You can merge differences in the Synchronization view on two 
    levels:&nbsp;</P>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      <p CLASS="Para"><b>Whole Document.</b> In the Structure Compare editor, 
        select the resource that you want to merge, so that the resource is displayed 
        in the Text Compare editor. In the Text Compare editor, click the Copy 
        whole document from right to left button to entirely replace the text 
        in your local editor with the contents of the branch resource.
    </li>
    <li> 
      <p CLASS="Para"><b>Current Change. </b>In the Text Compare editor, either 
        use the Go to Next Difference and Go to Previous Difference buttons to 
        navigate to the change that you want to merge, or simply click in either 
        source pane somewhere in the desired change difference fragment. Click 
        the Copy current change from right to left button as needed to overwrite 
        the highlighted fragment either with the corresponding modification in 
        the branch.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2> <a name="AutoMergingChanges">Auto Merging Changes</a></h2>
  <p>It is also possible to have your changes automatically merged for you. For 
    any resource marked as ASCII, performing a <b>Team &gt; Update</b> will automatically 
    merge into your local resource differences with the branch resource. This 
    works fine provided there are no lines with conflicting changes. If there 
    are, CVS inserts special markup in the file to indicate those lines which 
    could not be merged.</p>
  <p>Updating from within the Synchronization view works a bit differently. In 
    the case of a conflict, updating will prompt you to either emerge in the changes 
    or replace the entire file contents with those of the remote.</p>
