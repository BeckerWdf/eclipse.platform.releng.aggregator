Views can be &quot;torn off&quot; from the workbench window and can &quot;float&quot; on the desktop on their own.
Even though a view is floating it continues to behave as a part of the perspective from which
it was detached. For example, if you hide a perspective that contains a floating view, the floating view is
hidden as well.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
To launch a view in a secondary window:</P>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para">Drag the view by its title bar to an area outside the
    current window.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para">After dropping the view in its new location, resize the view
    by dragging its borders.</li>
</ol>
