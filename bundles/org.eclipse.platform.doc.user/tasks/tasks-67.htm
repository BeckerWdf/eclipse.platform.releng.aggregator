(Hold down the Ctrl key to select more than one resource.)</li>  <li>Press the Delete key.</li>  <li>Click <b>Yes</b> in the dialog which appears.</li></ol><p><em>Tip:</em> You can achieve the same result by selecting <b>Delete</b>from the pop-up menu.</p><p>Deleting resources from the workspace will also delete the corresponding files and/orfolders from the local file system.  The only exception is linked resources, which arenot removed from the file system when you delete the link in the workspace.  However,deleting child resources of linked folders <em>will</em> delete those resourcesfrom the local file system.</p><p>In most cases it is possible to restore deleted files from the local history.  See the relatedtasks for more details.</p><p><img border="0" src="../images/ngrelc.gif" alt="Related concepts" width="159" height="27"><br><a href="../concepts/concepts-12.htm">Resources</a><br><a href="../concepts/cnav.htm">Navigator view</a><br><a href="../concepts/concepts-13.htm">Linked resources</a></p><p><img border="0" src="../images/ngrelt.gif" alt="Related tasks" width="159" height="27"><br><a href="tasks-42b.htm">Deleting projects</a><br><a href="tasks-42.htm">Creating a project</a><br><a href="tasks-43.htm">Creating a folder</a><br><a href="tasks-44.htm">Creating a file</a><br><a href="tasks-45.htm">Creating linked resources</a><br><a href="tasks-87b.htm">Restoring deleted resources from local history</a></p><p>&nbsp;<br><a href="../hglegal2002.htm"><img src = "../images/ngibmcpy2002.gif" alt="Copyright IBM Corporation and others 2000, 2002" border="0"></a></p></BODY></HTML>
