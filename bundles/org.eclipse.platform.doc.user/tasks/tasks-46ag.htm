<H1 CLASS="Head">Finding a resource quickly</H1>

<P>To navigate to a particular resource in a view such as the navigator view:
</P>

<ol>
  <li>From <b>Navigate</b> menu, select <b>Go To &gt; Resource</b>.</li>
  <li>In the window that opens, start typing the name of the
    resource in the <b>Pattern</b> field. As you type the file name, the system
    offers a list of possible matches, based on what you have entered so far.</li>
  <li>Select the resource that you want from the <b>Matching
    Resources</b> list, and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The view displays the selected resource. Note that the view must have focus for the <B>Go To &gt; Resource</B> action to be enabled.</p>
<p>
If you want to open a particular resource in an editor rather than select
it in a view, you can use the <b>Navigate &gt; Open Resource</b> action.
This action presents the same dialog as the <b>Go To &gt; Resource</b> action,
but immediately opens the matching resource for editing.
</p>
<p><em>Tip:</em>If the <b>Open Resource</b> and <b>Go To Resource</b>
actions don't appear in your perspective, you can add them by selecting
<b>Window &gt; Customize Perspective &gt; Other &gt; Resource Navigation</b>.
By default, these actions only appear in certain perspectives.  The <b>Go To Resource</b>
action is only enabled when a view containing resources has focus.
</p>

<p>You can also do a contextual search for character strings
contained within files in the Workbench. See the links to related tasks below.
