  <h1>Viewing a file's revision history</h1>
  <p>Every time you commit a file to the CVS repository, a new revision is created. Each revision is identified by a
  number (for example, 1.1 or 1.11.3.5). Along with each revision is stored the author, the date, and a commit
  comment.</p>
  <p>To view the resource history for a file:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the file in one of the navigation views. From the context menu, choose <b>Team &gt; Show
    History</b>.</li>
    <li>The History view will open and show a history for the selected CVS file.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Note:</em> The History view also shows you all version and branch tags that are associated with the file.</p>
  <p><em>Tip:</em> You can show different types of revisions (your options are: Local and Remote revisions, only Remote
  revisions or only Local revisions) by using the History view's mode toggle buttons. These toggle buttons are located
  on the History view toolbar.</p>
  <p><em>Tip:</em> You can drag and drop a file from one of the navigation views into the History view instead of
  choosing the menu item.</p>
  <p><em>Tip</em>: You can have the History view update automatically to the history of the file in the active editor
  by enabling the <strong>Link with Editor</strong> item in the view's toolbar.</p>
