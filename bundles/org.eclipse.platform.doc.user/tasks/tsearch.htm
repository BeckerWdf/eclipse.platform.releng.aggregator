<h1>Searching online help</h1>

<p>The help system includes a powerful full-text search engine that runs simple 
or complex queries on the documentation to help you find the information you
are looking for.</p>
<p>To search the online help:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Search field in the upper right-hand corner of the Help browser, 
  type the term or terms for which you want to search.
  </li>
  <li>Click <b>Search</b> or press Enter. The result set will be shown in the 
  Search Results view of the Help browser.</li>
  <li>To view the content of a topic in the result set, select it. Hits within 
  the selected topic are highlighted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember the following search expression rules: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unless otherwise stated, there is an implied AND between all search
        terms. In other words, topics that contain all the
        search terms will be returned. For example:
        <pre>Java project</pre>
        <p>returns topics that contain the word <i>Java</i> and the word <i>project</i>,
        but does not return topics that contain only one of these words.</li>
      <li>Use OR before optional terms. For example:
        <pre>applet OR application</pre>
        <p>returns topics that contain the word <i>applet</i> or the word <i>application</i>
        (or both).</li>
      <li>Use NOT before terms you want to exclude from search results. For
        example:
        <pre>servlet NOT ejb</pre>
        <p>returns topics that contain the word <i>servlet</i> and do not
        contain the word <i>ejb</i>. <b>Note:</b> NOT only works as a binary 
        operator (that is, &quot;NOT servlet&quot; is not a valid expression).</li>
      <li>Use ? for a single-character wildcard and * for a multi-character
        wildcard. For example:
        <pre>par?</pre>
        <p>returns topics that contain <i>part</i> or <i>park</i>, but not <i>
        participate</i>.
        On the other hand:</p>
        <pre>par*</pre>
        <p>returns topics that contain <i>part</i>, <i>park</i>, <i>participate</i>,
        <i>pardon</i>, and so on.</li>
      <li>Use double quotation marks around terms you want treated as a phrase.
        For example:
        <pre>&quot;creating projects&quot;</pre>
        <p>returns topics that contain the entire
        phrase <i>creating projects</i>, and not <i>creating</i> or <i>project</i>
        on its own. This expression will also return hits on stemmed versions of 
        the phrase, including <i>created projects</i> and <i>create project</i>.</li>
      <li>Punctuation acts as term delimiters. For example:<pre>plugin.xml</pre>
      <p>returns hits on topics that contain <i>plugin.xml</i>, <i>plugin</i>, 
      and <i>xml</i>, which is likely broader than you want. If you want to find 
      just those topics containing <i>plugin.xml</i>, use double quotes, as in:</p>
      <pre>&quot;plugin.xml&quot; </pre>
      </li>
      <li>The search engine ignores character case. For example:
        <pre>Workbench</pre>
        <p>returns topics that contain 'workbench', 'Workbench', 'WorkBench',
        and 'WORKBENCH'.</li>
      <li>The following stop words are common English words which will ignored 
      (not searched for) if they appear in the search expression: a, and, are, 
      as, at, be, but, by, in, into, is, it, no, not, of, on, or, s, such, t, 
      that, the, their, then, there, these, they, to, was, will, with.</li>
      <li>The search engine does  &quot;fuzzy&quot; searches and word
        stemming.  If you
        enter <i>create</i>, it will return hits on topics that contain <i>creates</i>,
      <i>creating</i>, <i>creator</i>, and so on.</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Refining the search results</h2>
<p>If the result set is very large, the information you are looking for might
not appear in the top 10 or 15 results. You can then refine the search to reduce
the number of results.</p>
<p>To refine a search:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the <b>Advanced</b> link. </li>
  <li>Enter a search expression. In the Advanced Search window, the search 
  expression field is longer, making it easier to enter a complex expression, 
  but any expression you enter here will work from the main browser's search 
  field, too. </li>
  <li>Select one or more books (or sets of information) you want to search in. 
  These books are the groups of information that appear on the Bookshelf when 
  you first open the Help browser.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Search</b>. The results will be shown in the Search Results view 
  in the Help browser.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Search index generation</h2>

<p>The first time you search the online help, the help system might initiate an
index-generation process. This process builds the indexes for the search engine
to use. It may take
several minutes, depending on the amount of documentation.</p>
<p>Each time you add or modify the documentation set (for example, when you
install a new feature or update an existing one), the index will be updated to reflect the new
information set.</p>
