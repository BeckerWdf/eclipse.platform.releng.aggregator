<h1>Searching online help</h1>

<p>The help system includes a powerful text search engine that runs simple 
or complex queries on the documentation to help you find the information you
are looking for.
</p>

<p>To search the online help:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the <b>Search</b> field at the top of the Help browser, 
  type the term or terms for which you want to search.
  </li>
  <li>Click <b>Go</b> or press Enter. The result set will be shown in the 
  Search Results view of the Help browser.</li>
  <li>To view the content of a topic in the result set, select it. Hits within 
  the selected topic are highlighted.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Tip:</em> You can also search the documentation from inside the Workbench
  by
selecting <b>Search &gt; Search...</b>, and then Help<b> Search</b> tab. Type
in search terms, optionally select the books you
want to search, and click <b>Search</b>. The results will be shown in the Search
view. 
Double-click a result to open the help browser to that topic.
</p>

<p>Remember the following search expression rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unless otherwise stated, there is an implied AND between all search terms. 
    In other words, topics that contain all the search terms will be returned. 
    For example: 
    <pre>Java project</pre>
    <p>returns topics that contain the word <i>Java</i> and the word <i>project</i>, 
      but does not return topics that contain only one of these words.</li>
  <li>Use OR before optional terms . For example: 
    <pre>applet OR application</pre>
    <p>returns topics that contain the word <i>applet</i> or the word <i>application</i> 
      (or both).</li>
  <li>Use NOT before terms you want to exclude from search results. For example: 
    <pre>servlet NOT ejb</pre>  
    <p>returns topics that contain the word <i>servlet</i> and do not contain 
      the word <i>ejb</i>. <b>Note:</b> NOT only works as a binary operator (that 
      is, &quot;NOT servlet&quot; is not a valid expression).</li>
  <li>Use ? for a single-character wildcard and * for a multi-character wildcard. 
    For example: 
    <pre>par?</pre>
    <p>returns topics that contain <i>part</i> or <i>park</i>, but not <i> participate</i>. 
      On the other hand:</p>
    <pre>par*</pre>
    <p>returns topics that contain <i>part</i>, <i>park</i>, <i>participate</i>,
      <i>pardon</i>, and so on. <b>Note:</b> The search engine does not accept
      terms with a wild card at first character position.</li>
  <li>Use double quotation marks around terms you want treated as a phrase. For 
    example: 
    <pre>&quot;creating projects&quot;</pre>
    <p>returns topics that contain the entire phrase <i>creating projects</i>, 
      and not <i>creating</i> or <i>project</i> on its own.</li>
  <li>Punctuation acts as term delimiters. For example:
    <pre>plugin.xml</pre>
    <p>returns hits on topics that contain <i>plugin.xml</i>, <i>plugin</i>, and 
      <i>xml</i>, which is likely broader than you want. If you want to find just 
      those topics containing <i>plugin.xml</i>, use double quotes, as in:</p>
    <pre>&quot;plugin.xml&quot;</pre></li>
  <li>The search engine ignores character case. For example: 
    <pre>Workbench</pre>
    <p>returns topics that contain 'workbench', 'Workbench', 'WorkBench', and 
      'WORKBENCH'.</li>
  <li>The following stop words are common English words which will be ignored 
    (not searched for) if they appear in the search expression: a, and, are, as, 
    at, be, but, by, in, into, is, it, no, not, of, on, or, s, such, t, that, 
    the, their, then, there, these, they, to, was, will, with.</li>
  <li>The search engine does &quot;fuzzy&quot; searches and word stemming. If 
    you enter <i>create</i>, it will return hits on topics that contain <i>creates</i>, 
    <i>creating</i>, <i>creator</i>, and so on.  To prevent search engine from stemming
    terms, enclose them in double quotes.</li>
</ul>
	
<h2>Refining the search results</h2>

<p>If the result set is very large, the information you are looking for might
not appear in the top 10 or 15 results. You can then refine the search to reduce
the number of results.
</p>

<p>To refine a search:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click the <b>Search scope</b> link.</li>
  <li>Click <b>New</b> button to define a new search scope.</li>
  <li>In the window that opened, <b>select</b> the topics to which you want to narrow the search.</li>
  <li>Give the selected list a name and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b>, to activate the new search scope.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Go</b> again. The results will be shown in the Search Results view 
    in the Help browser.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Search index generation</h2>

<p>The first time you search the online help, the help system might initiate
  an  index-generation process. This process builds the indexes for the search
  engine 
to use. It may take several minutes, depending on the amount of documentation.
  Results of the search will be available upon completion of the indexing process.</p>

<p>Each time you add or modify the documentation set (for example, when you install 
a new feature or update an existing one), the index will be updated to reflect 
the new information set.
