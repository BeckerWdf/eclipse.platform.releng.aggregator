<h1>Browsing for available software</h1>
<p>To browse for available software and select software items to install in the
   system (requires Internet access):
</p>

  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
  <b>Help &gt; Install New Software...</b></a>.  This wizard shows you the items that are
    available for installation.</li>
  <li>You may type the location of a software site or select an existing software site
    using the <b>Work With</b> combo at the top of the page.  By default, the items in
    a site are grouped by category, with only the latest version of each item shown.
    You can change the way
    that you browse available software using the following methods:
    <ul>
    <li>Using the <b>Work With</b> combo box, you can select a site to browse its
    contents, or you can choose to browse software from all sites.  Browsing all 
    sites is useful when you know the name of something but do not know where it
    is located.</li>
    <li>The filter box can be used to type part of the name of something that you are
    looking for.  The list of items will be filtered to only those matching the
    text that you type.</li>
    <li>A checkbox at the bottom of the page can be used to control whether the items
    should be grouped in categories, or listed by name. </li>
    <li>A checkbox at the bottom of the page can be used to control whether
    all versions, or only the latest versions, of software are shown in the list. </li>
    <li>A checkbox at the bottom of the page can be used to control whether
    items that are already installed should be shown in the list.</li> 
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>As you browse the available software, check the items that you wish to install.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you have finished making your selections, click <b>Next</b> to install the checked items.  
    A checkbox at the bottom of this page controls whether all software sites will contacted when looking
    for software that is required to complete the install.
  </li>
  <li>Once you click <b>Next</b>, the wizard will validate your selections against your installed software, and report any configuration
    problems that might prevent you from installing a particular software item.
   </li>
   <li>If all of the requirements are available and there are no other installation
   conflicts, you will be able to
    review the items to be installed on the 
    <a href="tasks-124.htm">next page of the install wizard</a>.
