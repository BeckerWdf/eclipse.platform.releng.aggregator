Committing resources to the branch </H1>
<P CLASS="Intro"> <b>Tip</b>: Before performing your first&nbsp;synchronize operation, 
  consider which files and directories you wish to ignore at commits an time, 
  and add those to the appropriate &quot;ignore&quot; facility.&nbsp;Once a resource 
  is under version control, it cannot easily be ignored in subsequent commit operations. 
  Resources come under version control in the first place when a synchronize operation 
  is performed on a resource or any of its parent folders. See &quot;<a href="tasks-100d.htm">Filtering 
  resources from a commit</a>.&quot; 
<P CLASS="Intro"> You can commit workbench resources to the branch so that other 
  team members can update with themyour work.&nbsp; To commit changes to a branch: 
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">In the Navigator view, select the resources that you want 
      to commit to the branch.
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">Right-click to open the pop-up menu and select <b> Team &gt; 
      Synchronize with Stream.</b>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">Switch to the Team perspective. On the toolbar of the Synchronize 
      view, select the <b> outgoing mode</b> button to show any modified workbench 
      resources (outgoing changes) that you may have.
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">If there are conflicts (red arrows), resolve them. Use the 
      text compare area to merge&nbsp; resources with conflicts. You can copy 
      changes from the repository version of the resource to the workbench version 
      of the resource and save the merged workbench resource.&nbsp; Once all the 
      conflicts in the Structure Compare area have been resolved, you are ready 
      to commit.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">When there are no conflicts, you can commit all resources 
      to the branch. In the Structure Compare pane, right-click the top of the 
      hierarchy that you want to commit, and select <b>Release</b> from the pop-up 
      menu.
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro"> In the Commit Comment Needed dialog box, provide a comment 
      for this commit (for example, <samp>Fixed the spelling mistakes</samp>).
  </li>
</ol>
