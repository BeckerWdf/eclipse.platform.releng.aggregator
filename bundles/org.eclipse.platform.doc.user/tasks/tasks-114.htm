<b>Tip</b>: Before performing your first&nbsp; synchronize operation, consider
which files and directories you wish to ignore at release time, and add those to
the appropriate &quot;ignore&quot; facility.&nbsp;Once a resource is under
version control, it cannot easily be ignored in subsequent release operations.
Resources come under version control in the first place when a synchronize
operation is performed on a resource or any of its parent folders. See &quot;<a href="tasks-100d.htm">Filtering
resources from a release</a>.&quot;
<P CLASS="Intro">

You can release workbench resources to the stream so that other team members can
catch up with your work.&nbsp; To release changes to a stream:
<ol>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">In the Navigator view, select the resources that
you want to release to the stream.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">Right-click to open the pop-up menu and select <b> Team &gt; Synchronize with Stream.</b></li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">Switch to the Team perspective. On the toolbar of the
    Synchronize view, select the <b> Release mode</b> button to show any modified workbench resources (outgoing changes)
    that you
may have.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">If there are conflicts (red arrows), resolve them. Use the
text compare area to merge&nbsp; resources with conflicts. You can copy
changes from the repository version of the resource to the workbench version of
the resource and save the merged workbench resource.&nbsp; Once all the
conflicts in the Structure Compare area have been resolved, you are ready to
release.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">When there are no conflicts, you can release all resources
    to the stream. In the Structure Compare pane, right-click the top of the hierarchy
    that you want to release, and select <b>Release</b> from the pop-up menu.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">
In the Release Comment Needed dialog box, provide a comment for this release
    (for example, <samp>Fixed the
spelling mistakes</samp>).</li>
</ol>


    <p CLASS="Intro">
<b>Tips</b>:&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro"> To configure the workbench to switch automatically to the Team
perspective on release and catch-up operations, select <b> Workbench &gt;
Preferences &gt; Team</b> from the main menu bar.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para">You can also change the prefix label for outgoing changes that
appears in the Navigator view, when the <b> Show Version Info</b> menu item is
    enabled, on the Team preferences page.</li>
</ul>
