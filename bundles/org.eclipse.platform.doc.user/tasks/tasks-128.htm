<H1>Working with the Available Software sites</H1>
<p>The <b>Available Software Sites</b> dialog allows you to define the software
sites that are consulted when browsing for available software or updating the
system.  To manage the list of sites used by the system:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click
  <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.sdk.update")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png">
  <b>Help &gt; Software Updates ...</b></a> and select the 
  <b>Available Software</b> page. This page shows you the items that are
    available for installation.</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Manage Sites...</b> button to see the list of sites that
  are used to gather the available software and search for updates.</li>
  <li>All sites registered in the system are shown in the list.  Sites with
  a check mark are those that are used to search for updates and browse
  available software.  Sites without a check mark are not currently used.</li>
  <li>Select a site and click <b>Properties</b> to see information about the
  site, such as its location, name, or description.  This dialog may also
  contain status information about the site, such as when the site is not
  available on the network.</li>
  <li>You may check or uncheck a site in order to control whether it is
  used for updates and add-ons.  For example, you may
  wish to uncheck a site that is temporarily not available or experiencing
  network problems in order to speed up the search for updates.</li>
 </ol>
<p>
You may change the sites that are used by the system in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To add sites to the system:
<ul>
<li>Click <b>Add...</b> to enter the location of a new site.</li>
<li>You may check mark an unchecked site it in order to make it available
to the system.</li>
<li>Click <b>Import...</b> to import a list of sites that was previously
exported to a file.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To remove sites from the system:
<ul>
<li>Remove the check mark from the site if you want to temporarily
stop using the site.  This will keep the site in the list so that you can
check mark it later.</li>
<li>Click <b>Remove</b> to remove the site from the list of sites.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Click <b>Export...</b> to save the list of sites to a file.  This
is useful for sharing site lists with other users or across multiple
Eclipse installations.</li>
</ul>
