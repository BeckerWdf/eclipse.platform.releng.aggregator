  <h1>Working with a CVS repository</h1>
  <p>In the CVS team programming environment, team members do all of their work in their own Workbenches, isolated from
  others. Eventually they will want to share their work. They do this via a CVS repository. The Workbench provides a
  number of mechanisms which support working with CVS repositories. See the Related tasks links for more details.</p>
