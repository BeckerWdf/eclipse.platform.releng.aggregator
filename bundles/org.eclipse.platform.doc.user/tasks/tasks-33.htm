<H1>Inspecting the current configuration</H1>

<p>The workbench about dialog (<b>Help</b> &gt; <b>About</b>) shows most
important information about the features and plug-in configured in the product.
To find out further detailed information about the current configuration:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the main update manager by clicking <b>Help</b> &gt; <b>Software Updates</b> &gt;
    <b>Update Manager</b>. This opens the update manager perspective.</li>
  <li>In the Install Configuration view, expand the Current Configuration item.
    The first tier of items are locations on the local computer where the files
    for features and plug-ins are stored. For a typical product, all features
    are installed in a single directory subtree. However, a feature that is
    installed as an extension of another product are usually located in a
    separate directory subtree.</li>
  <li>Expand the location to see the feature versions installed there.</li>
  <li>The nesting of the features indicates which child features are included in
    a given&nbsp; parent feature. Nested features act as a unit.</li>
  <li>Select a feature version and click <b>Show Details</b> to open the Preview
    view which presents more detailed information about the selected feature.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Show Disabled Features</b> icon (top bar of the <b>Install
    Configuration</b> view). Any feature versions that are disabled are now
    shown (you might not have any). Disabled feature versions are ones that are
    installed on the local computer but excluded from the current configuration.
    At most one version of any given feature can be present in a given
    configuration; usually the ones with the lower version numbers will be in a
    disabled state.</li>
  <li>Select a feature version and click <b>Show Status</b> to find out whether
    the selected feature is configured exactly as packaged. The status will show
    when a feature's plug-ins are present at different versions, or disabled due
    to missing prerequisite plug-ins that are expected to be supplied by some
    other feature.</li>
</ol>
