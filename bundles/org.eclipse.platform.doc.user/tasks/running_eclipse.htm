<h1>Running Eclipse</h1>
<p>After you install (unzip) the Eclipse driver in a directory (such as c:\eclipse),
start the Workbench by running the Eclipse executable file found in the
top level install directory. The executable file is called <samp>eclipse.exe</samp> on Windows
systems and <samp>eclipse</samp> on Linux systems. 

<b>Note:</b> the following discussion describes setting up on Windows systems. Setup on Linux is
analogous.</p>

<p>If you do not specify otherwise, the platform creates a default workspace
directory as a sibling of the executable (for example, c:\eclipse\workspace).
This workspace directory is used as the default content area for your projects
as well as for holding any required metadata. For shared or
multi-workspace installs you should explicitly state the location of your
workspace rather than using the default. There are two ways to control the
location of your workspace: using the current working directory or using the
-data command line argument.</p>

<p>Perhaps the easiest way of using the current working directory is to create a
shortcut using the following steps</p>

<ol>
  <li>Navigate to eclipse.exe in the Windows Explorer and using a right button drag, create a shortcut
    to eclipse.exe.</li>
  <li>Edit the properties of the shortcut such that the <b>Start in:</b>
    field identifies the location of your workspace (for example, c:\myworkspace).</li>
  <li>Close the properties dialog and double-click on the shortcut.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course you can get the same effect using a command prompt by changing
directory to your workspace directory and then running eclipse.exe.</p>

<p>To use the -data command line argument, simply add <code>-data <var>your_workspace_location</var></code>
 (for example, <code>-data c:\myworkspace</code>)
to the <b>Target</b> field in the shortcut properties, or include it explicitly on your
command line.</p>

<h2>Advanced Topics in Running Eclipse </h2>

<p>The Eclipse executable and the platform itself offer a number of execution
options of interest to people developing or debugging parts of Eclipse.
The general form of running the Eclipse executable is:</p>

<blockquote>

<pre>eclipse [platform options] [-vmargs [Java VM arguments]]</pre>

<p>All arguments following (but not including) the -vmargs entry are passed

<h2>Running on Different VMs&nbsp;</h2>
<h3>Running Eclipse on J9</h3>
<p>
When running Eclipse on J9 version 1.5, it is recommended that you use the following VM
options:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>eclipse.exe [eclipse arguments] -vm <var>path_to_j9w.exe</var> 
            -vmargs -ms:32 -mm:2048 -mo:32768 -moi:32768 -mca:32 -mco:128 -mx:2000000</pre>
</blockquote>
<p> When running Eclipse on J9 version 2.0, the default arguments chosen by J9W 
  should be suitable. However, to override the parameters which are automatically 
  set internally by the Eclipse executable, you must specify -vmargs with no following arguments 
  as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>eclipse.exe [eclipse arguments] -vm <var>path_to_j9w.exe</var> -vmargs</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Please refer to the J9 VM documentation and help for further information.</p>

<h3>Running Eclipse on the IBM Developer Kit, Java(TM) Technology Edition VM</h3>

<p>The default VM settings for IBM Developer Kit, Java(TM) Technology Edition 1.3 Linux work well for initial exploration, but
are not sufficient for large scale development. For large scale development you
should modify your VM arguments
to make more heap available. For example, the following setting will allow the Java heap to grow to 256MB:&nbsp;
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>-vmargs -Xmx256M </pre>
