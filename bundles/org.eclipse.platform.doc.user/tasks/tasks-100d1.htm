Creating a global ignore pattern</H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>When synchronizing resources, often there are resources 
  that you do not want to release to the repository. The workbench provides a 
  global pattern-matching facility for ignoring resources that can appear anywhere 
  in your project hierarchy.</P>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type"> From the main menu bar, select <b>Window &gt; 
      Preferences</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type"> In the left pane of the Preferences window, 
      expand the <b> Team</b> category and select <b> Ignored Resources</b>.&nbsp;This 
      displays a list of resource name patterns against which resources will be 
      screened, before they are considered as candidates for version control.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">Click the <b> Add</b> push button and type the pattern
    that you want to match, for example <samp>*.obj</samp>. Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">All files with an extension that matches the pattern 
  that you added will be excluded from version control.</p>


<p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">The patterns that you define may contain the wildcard 
  characters * and ?.&nbsp;The asterisk represents any sequence of zero or more 
  characters; the question mark represents a single character.&nbsp; For example, 
  you can specify a pattern of <samp>*~</samp>, which would match any temporary 
  files that end with a tilde (~).&nbsp;Any file or directory that matches any 
  one of the patterns will be ignored when files are being considered for version 
  control.&nbsp; You can temporarily disable ignoring the resource name pattern 
  by deselecting it from the list; you do not have to remove the specified pattern 
  from the list.<br>
</p>
<p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">It is important to note that the path leading up 
  to the resource name is not included in the matching.&nbsp; For example, for 
  the file &quot;/path/to/file.txt&quot;, only the string &quot;file.txt&quot; 
  is matched against the patterns.&nbsp; This facility is not intended for specifying 
  fully-qualified path names but for specifying globally-applicable patterns.</p>
