Creating a global pattern to filter resources from releasing</H1>
<P CLASS="Para" Label=Type>When synchronizing resources, often there are
resources that you do not want to release to the stream. The workbench provides
a global pattern-matching facility for ignoring files that can
appear anywhere in your project hierarchy. (By contrast, the CVS ignore facility
is most often used for ignoring directories.)</P>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">
From the main menu bar, select <b>Workbench &gt; Preferences</b>.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">
In the left pane of the Preferences window, expand the <b> Team</b> category and select
    <b>
Ignored Resources</b>.&nbsp;This displays a list of file patterns against which
resources will be screened, before they are considered as candidates for version
control.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">Click the <b> Add</b> push button and type the pattern
    that you want to match, for example <samp>*.obj</samp>. Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">All object files with an extension that matches the
pattern that you added will be excluded from future release operations.</p>


<p CLASS="Para" Label="Type">The patterns that you define may contain the wildcard characters
* and ?.&nbsp;The asterisk represents any sequence of zero or more characters;
the question mark represents a single
character.&nbsp; For example, you can specify a pattern of <samp>*~</samp>, which would match
any temporary files that end with a tilde (~).&nbsp;Any file or directory that matches any one of the
patterns will be ignored during&nbsp; catch-up or release operations.&nbsp; When
you specify a file pattern to ignore, you can temporarily disable ignoring the
file pattern by deselecting it from the list; you do not have to remove the
specified file pattern from the list.<br>
<br>
The patterns in the global ignore facility are matched against resource names during a
synchronize operation.&nbsp; It is important to note that the path leading up to the resource name is not
included in the matching.&nbsp; For example, for the file &quot;/path/to/file.txt&quot;, only the string
&quot;file.txt&quot; is matched against the patterns.&nbsp; This facility is not intended for specifying fully-qualified
path names but for specifying globally-applicable patterns.</p>
