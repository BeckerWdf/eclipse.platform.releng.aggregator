<H1 CLASS="Head"> Changing the ASCII/Binary Property of Existing Files</H1>
<P CLASS="Para">CVS repositories distinguish between files that contain ASCII 
  data and those that do not. For ASCII files, additional helpful functionality 
  is available to the user. This includes:</P>
<ul>
  <li>Proper end-of-line conversion between the client and the server. This ensures 
    that a Windows user and a UNIX user can work on the same file without introducing 
    incompatibilities.</li>
  <li>Auto-merging of conflicts. If a file contains both incoming and outgoing 
    changes but none on the same line as another, then the file may be automatically 
    merged when updating.</li>
</ul>
<P CLASS="Para">At some time, you may wish to change whether a file should be 
  considered ASCII or Binary, even after this file is released in the repository. 
  One reason is that Eclipse 1.0 always commited files to the repository in Binary 
  mode, and you may want to change some of these to ASCII to take advantage of 
  additional functionality.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">To change the ASCII/Binary property of files:</P>
<ol>
  <li>If you will be modifying files that are already released in the repository, 
    tell your team members that you will be doing so; they will need to check 
    out fresh copies when you are done. Make sure they have committed any unreleased 
    changes.</li>
  <li>Select the files, or a folder or project, in the Navigator view. From the 
    context menu, select <b>Team &gt; Change ASCII/Binary Property...</b>.</li>
  <li>On the first page of the wizard, choose whether you want Eclipse to decide 
    the file type for you (based on the file type preferences), or whether you 
    want to specify the file type.</li>
  <li>On the second page, choose whether to include files that are already shared 
    in the repository. If you are modifying files that are already committed, 
    select the checkbox.</li>
  <li>On the third page, make sure that the table contains the expected changes. 
    You may deselect any files that you don't want to change.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Finish</b>. The files will be modified in the repository.</li>
  <li>Tell your team members that they need to check out fresh copies of the modified 
    projects. </li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note: </b>Changing the ASCII/Binary property of a file changes the property 
  for all revisions, in all branches and versions, past, present and future.</p>
