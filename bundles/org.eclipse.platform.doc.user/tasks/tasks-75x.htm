<p CLASS="Para">There are several types of markers including bookmarks, task
markers, and debugging breakpoints and problems. In this section we will focus
on tasks and the Task view.</p>
<p CLASS="Para">The Tasks view displays all the tasks and problems in the
workbench, both those associated with specific files (and even with specific
lines in specific files) as well as&nbsp; generic tasks that are not associated
with any specific file.</p>
<p CLASS="Para">In the figure below, &quot;sample task&quot; is a generic task
not associated with any specific resource. The second task (&quot;add sixth line
to the text&quot;) is associated with the file JanesFile.txt.</p>
