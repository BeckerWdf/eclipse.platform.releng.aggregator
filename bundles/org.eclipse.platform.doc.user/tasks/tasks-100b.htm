Merging from a stream</H1>
<P CLASS="Para">Merging takes changes between the initial state and the end
state in a stream, and merges
them into your workspace. Typically the initial state is the root of a stream (project version) and the end state
is either the
stream or another project version.<br>
<br>
It is very important to understand that the destination of the merge is always the project in your
workbench. After the merge has completed
you can test the changes locally and then release them to the new stream. </P>
<P CLASS="Para">To merge a project: </P>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para">In the Repositories view, select the
project that you want to merge.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para">From the project's pop-up menu, select <b>Add To Workspace</b>.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para">In the Navigator view, right-click the project and select <b>Team
    &gt; Merge</b> from the pop-up menu. The Merge wizard opens.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para">
In the Merge Setup page, select the project and the repository with which the
project is shared, and click <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para">
On the Choose Initial State page, choose the initial state of the merge.&nbsp; This will usually be the root project version on which the originating stream
was split.&nbsp; Select a version in the list and click <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para">On the Choose End State page, choose the end state of the
merge.&nbsp; This can be either a&nbsp; version (for example if
you versioned from your stream before the merge) or it can be a stream.&nbsp;
Click <b>Finish</b> to close the wizard.
A merge view opens in the editor area.&nbsp; This shows the changes between the initial and end state based on the resources in
your workspace.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para"> Catch up or merge changes within this view. At this point,
    you are working locally. You cannot release changes from within the merge view.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Para">
 After merging the changes, close the merge view and test and review the result of the merge. If you are happy with it, you can release the
changes to the destination stream.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Tip</b>: After merging changes into a stream, it is recommended that you create a project version to save the project's state after the merge. This project
version can be used to split again for subsequent merges. </p>
