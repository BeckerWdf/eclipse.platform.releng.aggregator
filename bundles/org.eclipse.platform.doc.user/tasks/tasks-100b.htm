<H1 CLASS="Head"> Merging from a branch</H1>
<P CLASS="Para">After creating and working in a CVS branch for some time, you may 
  want to merge your changes from the branch into another branch, or into HEAD. 
  To do this, you will need to know:</P>
<ol>
  <li>The name of the branch or version that contains your changes.</li>
  <li>The version from which the branch was created. This is the version name 
    that you supplied when branching.</li>
</ol>
<p>To merge your changes:</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para"> Ensure that the destination is loaded into your workspace. 
      For example, if you wish to merge your changes into HEAD, make sure the 
      project is shared with HEAD in your workspace. To do this, select the project 
      and choose <b>Replace With &gt; Branch or Version...</b> from the context 
      menu. Then select the branch to replace with.
  </li>
  <li>Select the project and choose <b>Team &gt; Merge...</b>.</li>
  <li>Enter the start point of the merge. This is the version from which the branch 
    was created. Click <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>Enter the branch or version which contains the changes you want to merge. 
    Click <b>Finish</b>.</li>
  <li>A Merge editor will open, showing all differences between your workspace 
    and the branch with the changes.</li>
  <li>Load all of the desired changes into the workspace. This may be accomplished 
    by either manually merging changes and then choosing <b>Save</b> from the 
    text editor's context menu, or by choosing <b>Update from Repository</b>, 
    <b>Override and Update</b>, or <b>Merge Changes Into Local Copy</b> from the 
    tree's context menu.</li>
  <li>After all desired changes are in the workspace, choose <b>Team &gt; Synchronize 
    with Repository</b>. You may then release all the changes into the destination.</li>
