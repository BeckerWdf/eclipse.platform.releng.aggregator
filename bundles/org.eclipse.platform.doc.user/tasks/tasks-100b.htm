<H1 CLASS="Head">Merging from a branch</H1>

<P>After creating and working in a CVS branch for some time, you may want to merge 
  your changes from the branch into another branch, or into HEAD. To do this, 
  you will need to know:
</P>

<ol>
  <li>The name of the branch or version that contains your changes.</li>
  <li>The version from which the branch was created. This is the version name 
    that you supplied when branching.</li>
</ol>

<p>To merge your changes:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure that the destination is loaded into your workspace. For example, 
    if you wish to merge your changes into HEAD, make sure the project is shared 
    with HEAD in your workspace. To do this, select the project and choose <b>Replace 
    With &gt; Branch or Version</b> from the context menu. Then select the branch 
    to replace with.</li>
  <li>Select the project and choose <b>Team &gt; Merge</b>.</li>
  <li>Enter the start point of the merge. This is the version from which the branch 
    was created. Click <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>Enter the branch or version which contains the changes you want to merge. 
    Click <b>Finish</b>.</li>
  <li>A Merge editor will open, showing all differences between your workspace 
    and the branch with the changes.</li>
  <li>Load all of the desired changes into the workspace. This may be accomplished 
    by either manually merging changes and then choosing <b>Save</b> from the 
    text editor's context menu, or by choosing <b>Update from Repository</b>, 
    <b>Override and Update</b>, or <b>Merge Changes Into Local Copy</b> from the 
    tree's context menu.</li>
  <li>After all desired changes are in the workspace, choose <b>Team &gt; Synchronize 
    with Repository</b>. You may then commit all the changes to the repository.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Merge actions</h3>
<p>The actions in the merge editor complement the manual merge toolbar actions 
  that are available in the bottom half of the merge editor.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr> 
    <td width="20%"><strong>Update from Repository</strong></td>
    <td width="80%">This action is enabled on resources that are incomming additions. 
      Running this action will bring the additions into the workspace.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><strong>Override and Update</strong></td>
    <td>This action is enabled on files with conflicting changes. Running this 
      action will discard any local changes you have and replace the file with 
      the remote contents.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><strong>Merge changes Into Local Copy</strong></td>
    <td>This action is enabled on files with conflicting changes. Running this 
      action will perform the equivalent of the &quot;cvs update&quot; command. 
      This will merge the local coontents with the remote contents using the base 
      as the ancestor. Changes are merged regardless of the conflicting state 
      of the files and can result in conflict markers (e.g. lines that can't be 
      automatically merged) in the local file.</td>
  </tr>
