Comparing resources</H1>
<p>When a comparison is performed, all applicable comparison 
editors appear in the editor area. In the comparison editors, the differences 
are highlighted so you can browse and copy changes between the compared 
resources. </p>

<p>To compare resources:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Select two or three resources in the Navigator view. </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the resource's pop-up menu, select <b>Compare With.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>The files are opened in the editor area, with
differences highlighted.&nbsp;
<p>Here are some of the comparisons that you can perform.&nbsp;

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Compare With &gt; Each Other</b> - compares two or three
    source files in the Navigator view with each other.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Compare With &gt; Local History - </b>compares the
    selected resource to one that is in the local history, which is maintained
    when you save changes. (<b>Tip</b>: to configure the size and depth of your
    local history, select <b>Workbench &gt; Preferences</b>.)</li>
  <li>
    <b>Compare With &gt; Version</b> - compares the selected
    resource with a version that has been released to the repository. This requires
you to choose a version of the resource from a list.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Compare With &gt; Stream Contents </b>- compares the
    selected resource&nbsp; with the
version of the same resource that is currently released to the stream.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <b>Compare With &gt; Base Version </b>- compares the
    selected resource&nbsp; with its state prior to modification, that is the
    version that you initially added from the repository.</li>
    </ul>

<p><b>Tip</b>: You can customize the behavior of the comparison editor by
selecting <b>Workbench &gt; Preferences &gt; Workbench &gt; Compare Viewers</b>
from the main menu bar. You can select to &quot;lock scroll&quot; the pane
contents, as well as setting options for showing conflicts with other team
members and changing the default font.</p>
