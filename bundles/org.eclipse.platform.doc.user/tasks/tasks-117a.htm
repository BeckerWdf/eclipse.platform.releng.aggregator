  <h1>Project checked out with another CVS tool</h1>
  <p class="Para">It is possible to use a CVS project checked out using another CVS tool into Eclipse. A common concern
  for those migrating to Eclipse is that they already have their CVS project checked out on their local machine. You
  <em>don't</em> have to check out the contents again to create a project in Eclipse. When such a project is imported
  into Eclipse, the CVS plug-in may detect that CVS folders exist and auto-share the project. However, there are some
  instance were this does not occur and the project will need to be shared manually within Eclipse in order to enable
  the CVS Team menu operations.</p>
  <p>To share an CVS project that was already checked out:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In one of the navigation views, select the project to be shared.</li>
    <li>Select <b>Team &gt;</b> <b>Share Project...</b> from the project's pop-up menu. The Share Project wizard
    opens.</li>
    <li>From the list of available repository providers, choose <b>CVS</b> and click <b>Next</b> to go to the next
    page. (<b>Note</b>: If CVS is not present in the list, it may be disabled. Clicking on the <strong>Show All
    Wizards</strong> button should make it visible.)</li>
    <li>The next page displays the sharing information stored in the CVS folder of the project. Click
    <strong>Finish</strong> to share the project and enable the CVS Team menu operations.</li>
  </ol>
