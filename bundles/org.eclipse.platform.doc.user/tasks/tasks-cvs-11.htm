<H1 CLASS="Head">Setting the CVS keyword substitution mode</H1>

<P>CVS uses the keyword substitution mode of a file to differentiate binary files 
from ASCII files and to indicate what type of keyword substitution is to take 
place when files are committed and checked out.
</P>
  
<P>To set the CVS keyword substitution mode:
</P>

<ol>
  <li>In the Navigator view, select the files or containing folders for which 
    a change in keyword substitution mode is desired. <b>Note</b>: Ensure that 
    any new files that are to be committed are added to CVS version control as 
    the keyword substitution mode can only be set for files that are already under 
    CVS control.</li>
  <li>From the pop-up menu, select<b> Team &gt; Change ASCII/Binary Property</b>. 
    The Set Keyword Substitution Mode wizard will open.</li>
  <li>On the first page of the wizard, select the mode to be applied to the selected 
    files: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Automatic</b> - uses the file type to determine whether selected 
        resources should use binary or the default ASCII mode (the default ASCII 
        mode is set on the Team > CVS preference page).</li>
      <li><b>Binary</b> - sets all selected files to binary. Files that are binary 
        are not altered in any way by CVS.</li>
      <li><b>ASCII without keyword substitution</b> - sets all the selected files 
        to ASCII but CVS does not perform any keyword substitution. The line endings 
        of ASCII files may be altered by CVS to align with a platform's line-terminator 
        convention.</li>
      <li><b>ASCII with keyword substitution</b> - sets all the selected files 
        to ASCII and CVS will perform the selected type of keyword substitution.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Click <b>Next</b> to go to the next page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>On the <b>Include versioned files</b> page of the wizard, indicate whether 
    files already shared in the repository are to be affected. If this setting 
    is disabled, only files that have been added to CVS control but not committed 
    will be affected. This page will only appear if there are files already shared 
    with the repository. Click <b>Next</b> to go to the next page.</li>
  <li>On the <b>Include files with outgoing changes</b> page of the wizard, indicate 
    whether files that have outgoing changes are to be affected. This page will 
    only appear if there are files with outgoing changes. Click <b>Next</b> to 
    go to the next page.</li>
  <li>On the <strong>Enter Commit Comment</strong> page of the wizard, enter the 
    commit comment to be associated with any file commits. Files will need to 
    be committed if changing the file type from Binary to ASCII results in a change 
    in the file content due to line terminator adjustments. Click <b>Next</b> 
    to go to the next page.</li>
  <li>On the <b>Summary</b> page of the wizard, inspect the proposed keyword substitution 
    mode settings to ensure they are correct. Click <b>Finish</b> to apply the 
    changes. </li>
</ol>

<p><em>Tip:</em> On the Summary page, the assigned mode for a file can be changed 
by clicking on the proposed mode in the table and selecting the desired mode 
from the drop down list that becomes available.
