  <h1 class="Head">Filtering CVS Revisions in the History View</h1>
  <p class="Para">Over time, the revision history for a file can grow drastically. As a result, it may be difficult to
  find the revision or revisions that you are looking for. Using the filtering mechanism of the History View can
  help.</p>
  <p class="Para">To set a filter on a CVS managed resource that is currently being displayed in the History View:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the <b>Filter...</b> action from the dropdown menu on the History View toolbar.</li>
    <li>Enter any branch, author, comment, or date range that you would like the view to display.
      <p><img src="../images/cvs_filter_res_history.png" alt="Filter Resource History dialog" border="0"></p>
    </li>
    <li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The view will now display only those revisions that match the criteria you entered.</p>
  <p><b>Tip:</b> You can remove the filter at a later time by selecting <b>Remove Filters</b> from the dropdown menu on
  the History View toolbar.</p>
  <p><b>Tip:</b> You can choose whether the filter should match any or all of the criteria by selecting the appropriate
  radio button in the dialog.</p>
