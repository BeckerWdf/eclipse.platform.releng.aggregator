<H1 CLASS="Head"> Updating</H1>
<P CLASS="Para"> While you are working in the workbench, other members of your 
  team may be committing changes to the branch you are working in (or HEAD). To 
  update the resources in your workbench, you may &quot;update&quot; your workbench 
  to match the state of the branch. You control when you choose to update.</P>
<p>The update command can be issued from two places: the <b>Team&gt;Update</b> 
  menu, or the <b>Synchronization</b> view. </p>
<p>If you update a file which has local uncommitted changes, CVS will attempt 
  to merge the changes of the remote file into your local file. This only occur 
  on files which CVS knows to contain text. </p>
<p>When you select the <b>Update</b> action in the synchronization view, you'll 
  be prompted before a merge is attempted and asked if you want to auto merge 
  the contents or overwrite them with the repository file. When you select the 
  <b>Team&gt;Update</b> action, no prompting will occur and those files which 
  can be merge will be merge. This matches the CVS commandline behavior.</p>
<p>When you catch up to a branch, you will see changes that have been released 
  to the branch since you last caught up. If you accept these incoming changes, 
  they are incorporated into your local workbench. If your local workbench contains 
  any outgoing changes that conflict with incoming changes from the branch, then 
  you must merge the differences in your workbench, as described below.</p>
<p CLASS="Para">To update:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">In the Navigator view, select the resources whose branch 
      you want to updating from.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">From the pop-up menu for the selected resources, select <b>Team 
      &gt; Synchronize with Repository</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">Switch to the Team perspective. On the toolbar of the Synchronize 
      view, click the <b> incoming mode</b> button to filter out any modified 
      workbench resources (outgoing changes) that you may have.</p>
    <p CLASS="Intro">
In the Text Compare area of the Synchronize view, local workbench data is represented on the left, and repository branch data
    is represented on the right. Click the <b> Show ... Changes</b> buttons in the Structure Compare editor as needed to display all differences.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">If there are conflicts (represented by red arrows), resolve 
      them. Use the text compare area to merge&nbsp; resources with conflicts. 
      You can copy changes from the repository revision of the resource to the 
      workbench copy of the resource and save the merged workbench resource.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">Once there are no conflicts, you can safely update all the&nbsp; 
      resources in the workbench without having to worry that you will lose changes 
      you made in the workbench. In the Structure Compare pane, right-click the 
      top-most resources that you want to updated, select <b>Update</b> from the 
      pop-up menu.
  </li>
</ol>
<p CLASS="Intro">The branch itself is not changed when you update. When you accept 
  incoming changes, these changes are applied to your workbench. The branch is 
  only changed when you commit wing whenyour outgoing changes.</p>
