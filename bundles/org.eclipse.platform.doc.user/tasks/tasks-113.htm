<H1 CLASS="Head"> Updating</H1>
<P CLASS="Para"> While you are working in the workbench, other members of your 
  team may be committing changes to the branch you are working in (or HEAD). To 
  get these changes, you may &quot;update&quot; your workbench 
  to match the state of the branch. You control when you choose to update.</P>
<p>The update command can be issued from two places: the <b>Team &gt; Update</b> 
  menu, or the <b>Synchronize </b>view. </p>
<p>If you update a file which has local uncommitted changes, CVS will attempt 
  to merge the changes of the remote file into your local file. This only occurs 
  on files which CVS knows to contain text. </p>
<p>When you select the <b>Update</b> action in the Synchronize View, you'll be 
  prompted before a merge is attempted and asked if you want to auto merge the 
  contents or overwrite them with the repository file. By contrast, when you select 
  the <b>Team &gt; Update</b> action, no prompting will occur and those files 
  which can be merge will be merged. This matches the CVS commandline behavior.</p>
<p>When synchronizing, you will see changes that have been released to the branch 
  since you last updated. If you accept these incoming changes, they are incorporated 
  into your local workbench. If your local workbench contains any outgoing changes 
  that conflict with incoming changes from the branch, then you must merge the 
  differences in your workbench, as described below.</p>
<p CLASS="Para">To update:</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">In the Navigator view, select the resources which you want 
      to update. 
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">From the pop-up menu for the selected resources, select <b>Team 
      &gt; Synchronize with Repository</b>. The Synchronize view will open. 
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">On the toolbar of the Synchronize View, click the <b> incoming 
      mode</b> button to filter out any modified workbench resources (outgoing 
      changes) that you may have.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">In the Text Compare area of the Synchronize view, local workbench 
      data is represented on the left, and repository branch data is represented 
      on the right. Examine the differences between the two.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">If there are conflicts (represented by red arrows), resolve 
      them. Use the text compare area to merge&nbsp; resources with conflicts. 
      You can copy changes from the repository revision of the file to the workbench 
      copy of the file and save the merged workbench file.&nbsp; 
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">Once there are no conflicts, you can safely update all the&nbsp; 
      resources in the workbench without having to worry that you will lose changes 
      you made in the workbench. In the Structure Compare pane, right-click the 
      top-most resources that you want to updated, select <b>Update</b> from the 
      pop-up menu. 
  </li>
</ol>
<p CLASS="Intro">The repository contents are not changed when you update. When 
  you accept incoming changes, these changes are applied to your workbench. The 
  repository is only changed when you commit your outgoing changes.</p>
