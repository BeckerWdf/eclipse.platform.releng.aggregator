<H1 CLASS="Head"> Updating</H1>
<P CLASS="Para"> While you are working on a project in the workbench, other members of your 
  team may be committing changes to the copy of the project in the repository. To 
  get these changes, you may &quot;update&quot; your workbench 
  to match the state of the branch. The changes you will see will be specific to the
  branch that your workbench project is configured to share.  You control when you choose to update.</P>
<p>The update command can be issued from two places: the <b>Team &gt; Update</b> 
  menu, or the <b>Synchronize </b>view. In order to understand the difference between 
  these two commands, it is important to know about the three different kinds of incomming
  changes:
  </p>
<ul>
  <li>A <i>non-conflicting</i> change occurs when a file has been changed remotely but has not been modified 
  locally.</li>
  <li>An <i>automergable conflicting</i> change occurs when an ASCII file has been changed both remotely 
  and locally (i.e. has non-committed local changes) but the changes are on different lines.</li>
  <li>A <i>non-automergable conflicting</i> change occurs when one or more of the same lines of an ASCII 
  file or when a binary file has been changed both remotely and locally (binary filea are never automergable).</li>
  </ul>

<p>When you select <b>Team &gt; Update</b>, the contents of the local resources 
  will be updated with incoming changes of all of the above three types. 
  For non-conflicting and automergable conflicts, there is no additional action required (for automergable
  conflicts, the changed local resource is moved to a file prefixed with &quot;.#&quot; just in 
  case the automerge wasn't what the user wanted).
  However, for non-automergable conflicts, the conflicts are either merged into the local resource 
  using special CVS specific markup text (for ASCII files) or the changed local resource is moved to 
  a file prefixed with &quot;.#&quot; (for binary files). This matches the CVS commandline behavior
  but can be problematic when combined with the Eclipse auto-build mechanism. Also, it is often desirable
  to know what incoming changes there are before updating any local resources. These issues are
  addressed by the Synchronize view.
<p>To open the Synchronize view in incoming mode:</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">In the Navigator view, select the resources which you want 
      to update. 
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">From the pop-up menu for the selected resources, select <b>Team 
      &gt; Synchronize with Repository</b>. The Synchronize view will open. 
  </li>
   <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">On the toolbar of the Synchronize View, click the <b> incoming 
      mode</b> button to filter out any modified workbench resources (outgoing 
      changes) that you may have.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>In incoming mode, you will see changes that have been committed to the branch 
  since you last updated. The view will indicate the type of each incoming change (non-conflict,
  automergable conflict or non-automergable conflict). There are two update commands (available 
  from the context menu of any resource in the view) to deal
  with the different types of conflicts: <b>Update</b> and  <b>Override and Update</b>.
  When you select the <b>Update</b> command in the Synchronize view, only non-conflicting
  changes are processed, leaving any files that have automergable or non-automergable conflicts 
  in the view (any files that have been successfully processed are removed from the view).
  The <b>Override and Update</b> command operates on the two types of conflicts. After
  selecting this command, you will be 
  prompted before a merge is attempted and asked if you want to auto merge the 
  contents or overwrite them with the repository file. If you select to auto merge then
  only automergable conflicts will be processed and the incoming changes will be automerged
  with the local changes. Otherwise all conflicts will be processed
  and the local resouces will be replaced with the remote contents. This &quot;replace&quot;
  behavior is rarely what is desired. An alternative is described later.
  </p>
<p>To update non-conflicting and automergable files:</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">The Structure Compare pane at the top of the Sychronize view
    contains the hierarchy of resources with incoming changes.
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">Select the non-conflicting files and choose <b>Update</b>
    from the popup menu. This will update the selected resources and remove them from the view.
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">Select the automergable conflicts and choose <b>Override and Update</b>
    from the popup menu. This will update the selected resources and remove them from the view.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>If your local workbench contains any outgoing changes 
  that are not automergable with incoming changes from the branch, then, 
  instead of performing an <b>Override and Update</b>, you can merge the 
  differences into your workbench manually, as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">In the Structure Compare pane, if there is a conflict in the 
    resource list (represented by red arrows), select it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">In the Text Compare area of the Synchronize view, local workbench 
      data is represented on the left, and repository branch data is represented 
      on the right. Examine the differences between the two.</p>
  </li>
  <li>  
    Use the text compare area to merge any changes. 
      You can copy changes from the repository revision of the file to the workbench 
      copy of the file and save the merged workbench file (using the popup menu in the left pane).
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Intro">Once you are completed merging the remote changes into a local file, choose
    <b>Mark as Merged</b> from the popup menu. This will mark the local file as having beebn updated 
    and allow your changes to be committed.
  </li>
</ol>
<p CLASS="Intro"><b>Note:</b> The repository contents are not changed when you update. When 
  you accept incoming changes, these changes are applied to your workbench. The 
  repository is only changed when you commit your outgoing changes.</p>

<p CLASS="Intro"><b>Tip:</b> In the Structure Compare pane, selecting an ancestor
of a set of incoming changes will perform the operation on all the appropriate 
children. For instance, selecting the top-most folder and choosing <b>Update</b>
will process all non-conflicting incoming changes and leave all other incoming changes 
unprocessed.
</p>

<p CLASS="Intro"><b>Warning:</b> The behavior of the <b>Override and Update</b> command
described above only applies to the incoming mode of the Synchronize view. In the 
<b>incoming/outgoing mode</b> of the view, the behavior for incoming changes is the same but 
the command will revert outgoing changes to whatever the repository contents are. 
Exercise great caution if using this command in incoming/outgoing mode.
