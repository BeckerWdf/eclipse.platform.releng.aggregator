Catching up</H1>
<P CLASS="Para">
While you are working in the workbench, other members of your team may be releasing changes to the
stream. To update
the resources in your workbench, you may &quot;catch up&quot; with the stream.
You control when you choose to catch up with a stream and
which incoming changes from a stream you want to accept into the workbench.</P>
<p CLASS="Para">When you catch up to a stream, you will see changes that have
been released to the stream since you last caught up. If you accept these
incoming changes, they are incorporated into your local workbench. If your local
workbench contains any outgoing changes that conflict with incoming changes from
the stream, then you must merge the differences in your workbench, as described
below.</p>
<p CLASS="Para">To catch
up:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">In the Navigator view, select the resources whose stream you want to catch up
with.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">From the pop-up menu for the selected resources, select <b>Team &gt; Synchronize with Stream</b>.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">Switch to the Team perspective.* On the toolbar of the Synchronize view,
    click the <b> Catch up mode</b> button to filter out any modified workbench resources (outgoing
changes) that you may have.</p>
    <p CLASS="Intro">
In the Text Compare area of the Synchronize view, local workbench data is represented on the left, and repository stream data
    is represented on the right. Click the <b> Show ... Changes</b> buttons in the Structure Compare editor as needed to display all differences.</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">If there are conflicts (represented by red arrows), resolve
    them. Use the text compare area to merge&nbsp; resources with conflicts. You can copy
changes from the repository version of the resource to the workbench version of
the resource and save the merged workbench resource.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p CLASS="Intro">Once there are no conflicts, you can safely
catch up all
the&nbsp; resources in the workbench without having to worry that you will lose
changes you made in the workbench. In the Structure Compare pane, right-click the top-most resources
    that you want to catch up with, select <b>Catch Up</b> from the pop-up menu.</li>
</ol>
<p CLASS="Intro">The stream itself is not changed when you catch up. When you
accept incoming changes, these changes are applied to your workbench. The stream
is only changed when you release your outgoing changes.</p>


<p CLASS="Intro">*<b>Tip</b>: To configure the workbench to switch automatically
to the Team perspective on release and catch-up operations, select Workbench
&gt; Preferences &gt; Team from the main menu bar.</p>
