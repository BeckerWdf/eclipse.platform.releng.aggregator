  <h1 class="Head">CVS Label Decorations</h1>
  <p class="Para">Label Decorations are used by CVS to show important synchronization information about workspace
  resources. Decorations can affect the text or the icon of the label associated with a resource. The text decorators
  are configurable on the <a href="../tasks/tasks-107b.htm">CVS Label Decorations Preference page</a> which can also be
  used to indicate which icons are to be enabled. Here is a description of the icons used by CVS.</p>
  <table width="94%" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><strong>Decoration</strong></td>
