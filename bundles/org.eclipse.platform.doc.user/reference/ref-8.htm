The workbench periodically saves a snapshot in order to reduce the risk of
losing data due to crashes.
<UL CLASS="UnorderedList">
<LI CLASS="Item">
Saved data is never lost as it is written to disk immediately (on save). </LI>
<LI CLASS="Item">
Unsaved data in open editors may be lost, depending on the editor implementation.  </LI>
<LI CLASS="Item">
Bookmarks and tasks might be lost.  </LI>
<LI CLASS="Item">
If a crash occurs during team synchronization, the workbench may be out of sync.
You can check the
version labels of resources in the workbench and the stream to see if the
synchronization completed. You may need to catch up and release resources to the
team stream again. </LI>
<LI CLASS="Item">
Previously-created projects are never lost.</LI>
</UL>
<p>Developers of plug-ins can also choose to participate in this lifecycle and save
the state of their plug-ins.</p>
