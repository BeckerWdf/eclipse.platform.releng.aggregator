<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H1 CLASS="Head"> CVS Synchronization View</H1>
<P CLASS="Para"> This view allows you to update resources in the workbench and 
  commit resources from the workbench to a repository.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
Here is what the Synchronization view looks like:</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
<img align="texttop" border="0" src="../images/Image245_sync_view.jpg" alt="Synchonization View"></P>
<DIV CLASS="XRefList"> 
  <h2 CLASS="Para">Modes</h2>
  <p> There are three different viewing modes (filters) that you can use in this 
    view to make the synchronization process easier:</p>
  <dl> 
    <dt>Incoming</dt>
    <dd>In this mode, only resources which have been changed in the repository 
      since they were last loaded or synchronized with those in the workbench 
      (incoming changes) are visible. If you have incoming changes when you synchronize, 
      you will start off in this mode.</dd>
    <dt>Outgoing</dt>
    <dd> In this mode, only resources which have been modified in the workbench 
      (outgoing changes) are visible.&nbsp;If you do not have incoming changes 
      when you synchronize, you will start in this mode.</dd>
    <dt>Incoming/Outgoing</dt>
    <dd> In this mode both incoming and outgoing changes are shown, and you can 
      both update and commit. You will remain in this mode with future synchronizations 
      until you close the view.&nbsp; The advantage to using this dual mode is 
      you can do either task as you choose. The disadvantage is that performing 
      a simultaneous bi-directional merge is often complicated. In addition, you 
      risk accidentally committing a conflict when you meant to update to it. 
      You can choose to always use Incoming/Outgoing mode on the workbench preferences 
      page (<b>Window&gt; Preferences &gt; CVS</b>).</dd>
  </dl>
  <P CLASS="Para">Modes not only filter the set of visible changes but also restrict 
    the set of operations available. They support and encourage the ideal work 
    flow. You can switch modes using the toolbar of the Synchronization view.&nbsp; 
  </P>
  <P CLASS="Para">Regardless of the mode that you select, you will always see 
    any conflicts that exist. You can filter out other outgoing and incoming changes 
    by clicking the <b> Show Only Conflicts</b> button.&nbsp; You can also choose 
    to Compare File Contents (and show only those resources whose contents differ), 
    Ignore Whitespace differences or Refresh From Repository from the dropdown 
    menu of this view.</P>
  <P CLASS="Para"> <b>Important</b>: It is preferable to update resources in the 
    workbench first, resolve any conflicts that exist by merging, then commit 
    workbench resources to the repository.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="Topic">
<h2>
Structure Compare Pane</h2>
  <P CLASS="Para"> This pane allows you to view a hierarchy tree of all the resource 
    differences between the repository and the workbench.</P>
</DIV>

<h2>
Text Compare Pane</h2>
<P CLASS="Para"> This pane allows you to view the content differences of the resource 
  selected in the structure compare pane. You can choose to ignore whitespace 
  differences from the view's drop-down menu.</P>
