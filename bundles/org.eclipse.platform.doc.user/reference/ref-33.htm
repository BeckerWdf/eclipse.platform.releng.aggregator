<h1>CVS Synchronization View</h1>
<p class="Para"> This view allows you to update resources in the workbench 
and    commit resources from the workbench to a repository.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   
<p class="Para"> Here is what the Synchronization view looks like:</p>
   
<p class="Para"> <img align="top" border="0"
 src="../images/Image245_sync_view.jpg" alt="Synchonization View">
 </p>
   
<div class="XRefList">     
<h2 class="Para">Modes</h2>
     
<p> There are three different viewing modes (filters) that you can use in 
this      view to make the synchronization process easier:</p>
     
<dl>
  <dt>Incoming</dt>
  <dd>In this mode, only resources which have been changed in the repository 
       since they were last loaded or synchronized with those in the workbench 
       (incoming changes) are visible. If you have incoming changes when you
synchronize,        you will start off in this mode.</dd>
  <dt>Outgoing</dt>
  <dd> In this mode, only resources which have been modified in the workbench 
       (outgoing changes) are visible.&nbsp;If you do not have incoming changes 
       when you synchronize, you will start in this mode.</dd>
  <dt>Incoming/Outgoing</dt>
  <dd> In this mode both incoming and outgoing changes are shown, and you 
can        both update and commit. You will remain in this mode with future 
synchronizations        until you close the view.&nbsp; The advantage to using
this dual mode is        you can do either task as you choose. The disadvantage
is that performing        a simultaneous bi-directional merge is often complicated.
In addition, you        risk accidentally committing a conflict when you
meant to update to it.        You can choose to always use Incoming/Outgoing
mode on the workbench preferences        page (<b>Window&gt; Preferences
&gt; CVS</b>).</dd>
</dl>
     
<p class="Para">Modes not only filter the set of visible changes but also 
restrict      the set of operations available. They support and encourage 
the ideal work      flow. You can switch modes using the toolbar of the Synchronization 
view.&nbsp;    </p>
     
<p class="Para">Regardless of the mode that you select, you will always see 
     any conflicts that exist. You can filter out other outgoing and incoming 
changes      by clicking the <b> Show Only Conflicts</b> button.&nbsp; You 
can also choose      to Compare File Contents (and show only those resources 
whose contents differ),      Ignore Whitespace differences or Refresh From 
Repository from the dropdown      menu of this view.</p>
     
<p class="Para"> <b>Important</b>: It is preferable to update resources in 
the      workbench first, resolve any conflicts that exist by merging, then 
commit      workbench resources to the repository.</p>
  </div>
   
<div class="Topic">  
<h2> Structure Compare Pane</h2>
     
<p class="Para"> This pane allows you to view a hierarchy tree of all the 
resource      differences between the repository and the workbench.</p>
  </div>
    
<h2> Text Compare Pane</h2>
   
<p class="Para"> This pane allows you to view the content differences of the
resource    selected in the structure compare pane. You can choose to ignore
whitespace    differences from the view's drop-down menu.</p>
