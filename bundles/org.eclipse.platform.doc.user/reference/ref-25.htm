<h1 class="Head"> Compare editor</h1>
       
<p class="Para"> You can view the differences between two files by comparing 
 them.    You can compare different files, and you can compare versions in 
 the Workbench    with versions in the repository or with the local edit history.&nbsp;
 In some    cases you can compare three files (when a common ancestor exists).
 </p>
       
<p class="Para"> After a comparison is carried out, the Compare editor opens 
 in    the editor area. In the compare editor, you can&nbsp; browse through 
 all the    differences and copy highlighted differences between the compared 
 resources.    You can save changes to resources that are made in the comparison 
 editor. </p>
       
<p class="Para">Here is how the compare editor looks when you synchronize 
    with a CVS repository. The compare editor is the bottom portion of the 
view (whose    titlebar is Text Compare).</p>

<h2>Toolbar</h2>
       
<p>The toolbar of the Compare editor includes the following buttons:</p>
           
<dl>
  <dt>Control Visibility of Ancestor Pane</dt>
  <dd>There are two conditions under which a three-way compare will occur, 
          both when using the Team version management support: when comparing 
 a          file that is in conflict, and when comparing a file being merged 
 from          a branch. In both cases, the system will determine a common 
 ancestor in          the repository to compare the conflict or merge against. 
 This button determines          the visibility of the third editor. By default, 
 the ancestor pane is not          visible.</dd>
  <dt>Perform Three-way/Two-way Compare</dt>
  <dd>The compare editor can be toggled between performing a three-way compare 
          or a two-way compare which ignores the common ancestor.</dd>
  <dt>Copy Whole Document from Left to Right</dt>
  <dd>Copies the entire contents of the file in the left pane into the file 
          in the right pane, making the contents of the two files identical.&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt>Copy Whole Document from Right to Left</dt>
  <dd>Does the opposite of the one just described.</dd>
  <dt>Copy Current Change from Left to Right</dt>
  <dd>Merges changes in two files by copying the highlighted change in the 
          left pane into the highlighted fragment on the right.&nbsp; This 
 will          overwrite the highlighted fragment in the right pane.</dd>
  <dt>Copy Current Change from Right to Left</dt>
  <dd>Does the opposite of the one just described.</dd>
  <dt>Select Next Difference</dt>
  <dd>Highlights the next difference that is found between the compared resources.</dd>
  <dt>Select Previous Difference</dt>
  <dd>Highlights the previous difference that is found between the compared 
          resources.</dd>
