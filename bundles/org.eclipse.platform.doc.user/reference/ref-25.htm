Compare editor</H1>
<P CLASS="Para"> You can view the differences between two files by comparing them. 
  You can compare different files, and you can compare versions in the workbench 
  with versions in the repository or with the local edit history.&nbsp; In some 
  cases you can compare three files (when a common ancestor exists). </P>
<P CLASS="Para"> After a comparison is carried out, the Compare editor opens in 
  the editor area. In the compare editor, you can&nbsp; browse through all the 
  differences and copy highlighted differences between the compared resources. 
  You can save changes to resources that are made in the comparison editor. </P>
<P CLASS="Para">Here is how the compare editor that is looks when you synchronize 
  with a CVS repository. he compare editor is the bootom portion of the view (whose 
  titlebar is Text Compare).</P>

<h2>Toolbar</h2>
<p>The toolbar of the Compare editor includes the following buttons.</p>
    <dl> 
      <dt>Control Visibility of Ancestor Pane</dt>
      <dd>There are two conditions under which a three-way compare will occur, 
        both when using the Team version management support: when comparing a 
        file that is in conflict, and when comparing a file being merged from 
        a branch. In both cases, the system will determine a common ancestor in 
        the repository to compare the conflict or merge against. This button determines 
        the visibility of the third editor. By default, the ancestor pane is not 
        visible.</dd>
      <dt>Perform Three-way/Two-way Compare</dt>
      <dd>The compare editor can be toggled between performing a three-way compare 
        or a two-way compare which ignores the common ancestor.</dd>
      <dt>Copy Whole Document from Left to Right</dt>
      <dd>Copies the entire contents of the file in the left pane into the file 
        in the right pane, making the contents of the two files identical.&nbsp;</dd>
      <dt>Copy Whole Document from Right to Left</dt>
      <dd>Does the opposite of the one just described.</dd>
      <dt>Copy Current Change from Left to Right</dt>
      <dd>Merges changes in two files by copying the highlighted change in the 
        left pane into the highlighted fragment on the right.&nbsp; This will 
        overwrite the highlighted fragment in the right pane.</dd>
      <dt>Copy Current Change from Right to Left</dt>
      <dd>Does the opposite of the one just described.</dd>
      <dt>Select Next Difference</dt>
      <dd>Highlights the next difference that is found between the compared resources.</dd>
      <dt>Select Previous Difference</dt>
      <dd>Highlights the previous difference that is found between the compared 
        resources.</dd>
