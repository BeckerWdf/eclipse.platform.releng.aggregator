cases you can compare three files. </P>

<h2>Toolbar</h2>
<p>The toolbar of the Compare editor includes the following buttons.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Control Visibility of Ancestor Pane</dt>
  <dd>There are two conditions under which a three-way compare will occur, both
when using the Team version management support: when comparing a file that is in
conflict, and when comparing a merged file. In both cases, the system will
determine a common ancestor in the version repository to compare the conflict or
merge against. This button determines the visibility of the third editor. By default, the ancestor pane is not
visible.</dd>
  <dt>Copy Current Change from Left to Right</dt>
  <dd>Merges changes in two files by copying the
highlighted change in the left pane into the highlighted fragment on the right.&nbsp;
This will overwrite the highlighted fragment in the right pane.</dd>
  <dt>Copy Current Change from Right to Left</dt>
  <dd>Does the opposite of the one just described.</dd>
  <dt>Copy Whole Document from Left to Right</dt>
  <dd>Copies the entire
contents of the file in the left pane into the file in the right pane, making
the contents of the two files identical.&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt>Copy Whole Document from Right to Left</dt>
  <dd>Does the opposite of the one just described.</dd>
  <dt>Select Next Difference</dt>
  <dd>Highlights the next difference that is found between the compared resources.</dd>
  <dt>Select Previous Difference</dt>
  <dd>Highlights the previous difference that is found between the compared resources.</dd>
