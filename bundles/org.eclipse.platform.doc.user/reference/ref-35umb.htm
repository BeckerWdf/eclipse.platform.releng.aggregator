<h1>Install Configuration view</h1>
     
<p>The Install Configuration view, which is part of the Install/Update
 perspective, allows you to manage your workspace configuration. The 
 <b>Current Configuration</b> folder shows which local installation locations are
 part of the workspace configuration, and which features are installed in those
 locations. The <b>Configuration History</b> folder shows a history of changes made to your
 workspace configuration. The <b>Saved Configurations</b> folder show any configurations
 that were preserved (typically representing a stable configuration that
 can be used as a base to recover to).
