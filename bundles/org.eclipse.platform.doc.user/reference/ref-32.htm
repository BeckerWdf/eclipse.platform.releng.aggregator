<h1> CVS Repositories view</h1>
<P CLASS="Para">The CVS Repositories view, which is part of the CVS Repository 
  Exploring perspective, shows the CVS repository locations that you have added 
  to your workbench.&nbsp;Expanding a location reveals the main trunk (HEAD), 
  project versions and branches in that repository. You can further expand the 
  project versions and branches to reveal the folders and files contained within 
  them. </P>
<p>The pop-up menu for this view also allows you to specify new repository locations. 
  Use the CVS Repositories view to checkout out resources from the repository 
  to the workbench, configure the branches and versions shown by the view, view 
  resource history, and compare resource versions. </p>
<P CLASS="Para">
Here is what the Repositories view looks like:</P>
<P CLASS="Para">

<DIV CLASS="Topic"> 
  <p>Like other views in the workbench, the CVS Repositories view has its own 
    toolbar. Toolbar buttons are provided for refreshing the view and for navigating. 
    The toolbar also contains a drop down menu that allows the user to toggle 
    the view to show the folders contained in the repository or modules defined 
    in the CVSROOT/modules.</p>

<h3> Configure Branches and Versions</h3>
<P CLASS="Para"> This command brings up the wizard to help you discover the branch

  view so the resources that have these tags can be browsed.</P>
<h3>

  History view.</P>
