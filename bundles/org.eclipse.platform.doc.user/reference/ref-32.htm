<h1> CVS Repositories view</h1>
     
<p class="Para">The CVS Repositories view, which is part of the CVS Repository
    Exploring perspective, shows the CVS repository locations that you have
 added    to your Workbench.&nbsp;Expanding a location reveals the main trunk
 (HEAD),    project versions and branches in that repository. You can further
 expand the    project versions and branches to reveal the folders and files
 contained within    them. </p>
     
<p>The pop-up menu for this view also allows you to specify new repository
 locations.    Use the CVS Repositories view to checkout out resources from
 the repository    to the Workbench, configure the branches and versions
shown  by the view, view    resource history, and compare resource versions.
</p>
     
<p class="Para"> Here is what the Repositories view looks like:</p>

  </p>
     
<div class="Topic">      
<p>Like other views in the Workbench, the CVS Repositories view has its own
      toolbar. Toolbar buttons are provided for refreshing the view and for
 navigating.      The toolbar also contains a drop down menu that allows
the  user to toggle      the view to show the folders contained in the repository
 or modules defined      in the CVSROOT/modules file.</p>
       
<h2>Titlebar</h2>
       
<h3>Go Home</h3>
     
<p class="Para"> This command redraws the view, showing the repository locations.</p>
   </div>
     
<div class="Topic">     
<h3> Go Back</h3>
     
<p class="Para"> This command redraws the view, showing the hierarchy that
 was displayed immediately prior to the current display.</p>
   </div>
     
<div class="Topic">     
<h3> Go Forward</h3>
     
<p class="Para"> This command redraws the view, showing the hierarchy that
 was displayed immediately after the current display.</p>
   </div>
     
<div class="Topic">     
<h3> Refresh View</h3>
     
<p class="Para"> This command refreshes the contents of the Repositories
view.</p>
   </div>
     
<h3 class="Para">Drop Down Menu</h3>
     
<p class="Para">The drop down menu in the title bar allows the repositories
 view    to be toggled between showing folders and modules. <b>Show Folders</b>
   shows    the direct children of the repository directory on the server. 
<b> Show Modules</b>    shows the modules that are defined in the CVSROOT/modules
 file of the repository.</p>
     
<h2 class="Para">Context Menu </h2>
     
<p class="Para">From the context menu of the Repositories view you can  perform
a number    of interesting operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
     
<h3>  New &gt; Repository Location&nbsp;</h3>
     
<p class="Para"> This command brings up the wizard to help you specify a
new repository location.&nbsp;</p>
     
<h3> Configure Branches and Versions</h3>
     
<p class="Para"> This command brings up the wizard to help you discover the
 branch    and version tags that exist in the repository and add them to
the  repositories    view so the resources that have these tags can be browsed.</p>
     
<h3> Open</h3>
     
<p> This command opens the selected file in an editor.&nbsp; Since file revisions
    in the repository are immutable, the editor opens in a read-only state,
 so it    is not modifiable.&nbsp; </p>
     
<h3> Show in Resource History</h3>
     
<p> This command shows the revision history of the selected file in the CVS
 Resource    History view.</p>
     
<h3> Compare</h3>
     
<p class="Para">This command will compare on two or three selected  resources.</p>
     
<h3>Checkout as Project</h3>
     
<p>This command checks the folder out into a project in the Workbench with
 the    same name as the folder.</p>
     
<h3>Checkout as...</h3>
     
<p>This command checks the folder out into a project in the Workbench into
 a project    configured by the user.</p>
     
<h3> Tag as Version...</h3>
     
<p> This command versions the selected resource based on the current branch
 contents.</p>
     
<h3>Tag with Existing...</h3>
     
<p> This command versions the selected resource based on the current branch
 contents,    moving the tag from previously tagged resources if required.</p>
