Repositories View</h1>
<P CLASS="Para">
This view shows repository locations added by the
user.&nbsp;Expanding a location reveals the project versions and streams in that
repository. You can expand the project versions and streams to reveal the
folders and files contained within them. You can also add resources to the workbench, open
editors on files in the repository, view history, and compare resource versions.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
