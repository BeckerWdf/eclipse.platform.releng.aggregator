Shortcut bar</H1>
<P CLASS="Intro">
The shortcut bar is actually two different bars.  One bar manages the open perspectives, while another manages any open fast views.

<h2>Perspective Bar</h2>
<P CLASS="Intro">
The perspective bar allows quick access to perspectives that are currently open, as well
as providing an easy way to open a new perspective.&nbsp; The perspective bar may be docked in three different positions.  It may be docked in the upper right corner (the default position), the upper left corner (under the main toolbar) and to the far left.
<P CLASS="Para">
Here is an example of what the perspective bar looks like:&nbsp;</P>

<DIV CLASS="Topic">
<h3>
Open Perspective</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">
This command opens a new perspective which is
selected by the user from a drop-down menu.&nbsp; All of the perspectives that are open within a single Workbench window are
shown on the shortcut bar.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="Topic">
<h3>
Perspective Buttons</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">
These buttons provide a quick way to switch to one of the open 
perspectives in the current Workbench window.&nbsp;
</P>
</DIV>

<h2>Fast View Bar</h2>
<P class="Intro">
 The fastview bar is the place where fast views are docked.  It may be docked in three locations.  It may be docked on the left, bottom (default) and right.
</p>
Here is an example of what the fast view bar looks like:&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
<img src="../images/Image211_fastview.gif" alt="Fast View Bar" border="0" width="74" height="29"></P>

<DIV CLASS="Topic">
<h3>
View Buttons</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">
These buttons provide a quick way to display the
fast views in the current perspective.&nbsp; Fast views are essentially
minimized views that have been dragged onto the shortcut bar.&nbsp; Fast views
pop up when selected, and revert
back to their minimized state when the user clicks outside of the view and may be oriented either horizontally or vertically according to their configuration.&nbsp; 
To convert a fast view back into a normal view, click on the <i>Fast View</i> action
in the view's menu or drag it back to the workbench.&nbsp;</P>
