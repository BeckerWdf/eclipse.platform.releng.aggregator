<h1>Search</h1>
<p>
The Search preference page allows the user to set preferences for searches. The
<strong>Reuse editors to show matches</strong> option allows the user to keep using the same
editor for search results to reduce the number of open editors. <strong>Emphasize
potential matches</strong> is an option that allows you to highlight them in the Search view. If the Search engine isn't 100% sure about the match then it is considered a potential match. You may also set the
<strong>foreground color for potential matches</strong>. If you only want to see exact matches you can check <strong>Ignore potential matches</strong>. The <strong>Default perspective for the Search view</strong> allows you to define which perspective should be brought to front when there are new search results.</p>

<p>Here is what the Search preference page looks like:&nbsp;
