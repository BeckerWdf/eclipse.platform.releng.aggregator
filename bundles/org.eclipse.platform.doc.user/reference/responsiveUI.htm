<h2> Responsive UI</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">Many Eclipse functions run in the user interface thread, when 
  met with a slow operation, employing the Responsive UI, which allows the threading 
  of sequential code, will enable you to continue working elsewhere in Eclipse. 
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">For example, building a project can sometimes take more than a 
  few minutes, during which time you may wish to continue to use other functions 
  in Eclipse.

<p>While the project is being built, select <strong>Run in Background </strong>from 
  the Building Workspace window and the Responsive UI will allow you to carry 
  on with other tasks in Eclipse.</p>

<p>For additonal information on the status of the action, click <strong>Details</strong>.</p>

<p>Without the Responsive UI activated in the user interface thread the user would 
  be locked out of performing any other actions.</P> </p>
