Back</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">
This command displays the hierarchy that was displayed immediately prior to the current display.&nbsp;

take you. This command is similar to the Back button in a web browser.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="Topic">
<h2>
Forward</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">
This command displays the hierarchy that was displayed immediately after the current display.&nbsp;
For example, if you've just selected the Back command, then selecting the Forward command in the resulting display returns the view to the same hierarchy from which you activated the Back command.&nbsp;The

This command is similar to the Forward button in a web browser.</P>
