<P CLASS="Intro"> On the Team&gt;File Content preference page, you can associate 
  file extensions with the type of data the file contains. The two choices for 
  file content type are ASCII and Binary. Repository providers such as CVS can 
  then use this information to provide content type appropriate behavior. For 
  example, for ASCII files, CVS ensures that line terminators conform to those 
  of the OS platform. 
<P CLASS="Intro">Entries are added to the File Content page in two ways. The first 
  is through contributions from workbench plug-ins. Tools integrated into the 
  workbench provide the workbench with the file content types for file extensions 
  specific to the tool. The workbench itself also defines the file content type 
  for file extensions that are common and appear frequently in the workbench (e.g. 
  html, gif, etc.). 
<P CLASS="Intro">The second method is for users to add file content types explicitly 
  on the File Content preference page. To do so, the user can simply click on 
  the <strong>Add</strong> button and enter an extension. Following this, they 
  can toggle the type associated with the extension by selecting the entry for 
  the extension in the table and clicking <strong>Change</strong>. Entries can 
  be removed from the list by selecting them and clicking <strong>Remove</strong>.
