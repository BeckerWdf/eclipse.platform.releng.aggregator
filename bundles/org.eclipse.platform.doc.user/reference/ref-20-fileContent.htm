<P CLASS="Intro"> On the File Content preference page, you can associate file 
  names or extensions with the type of data the file contains. The two choices 
  for file content type are ASCII and Binary. Repository providers such as CVS 
  can then use this information to provide content type appropriate behavior. 
  For example, for ASCII files, CVS ensures that line terminators conform to those 
  of the OS platform. 
<P CLASS="Intro">Entries are added to the File Content page in two ways. The first 
  is through contributions from workbench plug-ins. Tools integrated into the 
  workbench provide the workbench with the file content types for file extensions 
  specific to the tool. The workbench itself also defines the file content type 
  for file extensions that are common and appear frequently in the workbench (for 
  example, html,.png, and so on). 
<P CLASS="Intro">The second method is for users to add file content types explicitly 
  on the File Content preference page. To do so, the user can simply click <strong>Add 
  Extension </strong> and enter an extension or click <strong>Add Name</strong> 
  and enter a name. Following this, they can toggle the type associated with the 
  name or extension by selecting the entry for the extension in the table and 
  clicking <strong>Change</strong>. Entries can be removed from the list by selecting 
  them and clicking <strong>Remove</strong>. Only those entries that were manually 
  added can be removed. Entries contributed through the plug-in manifest can only 
  be changed. <br>
