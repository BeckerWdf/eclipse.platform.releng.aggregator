Merge wizard</H1>
<P CLASS="Intro"> This wizard helps you merge changes between two states of a 
  project into your workspace. Often the Merge Wizard is used to move changes 
  from one branch into another, for example after splitting a branch to work on 
  a bug fix. The merge operation takes changes between two points in a branch, 
  the <b> start point</b> and the <b> end point</b>, and merges them into your 
  workspace. Typically the start point will be the root of a branch (version tag) 
  and the end point can either be the tip (latest and best) of the branch 
  or another version tag.<br>
  <br>
  It is very important to understand that the destination of the merge is always 
  the project in your workspace. After the merge has been completed you can test the 
  changes locally and then commit them to the new branch (usually HEAD).
<P CLASS="Intro">To start a merge, select a project (or one or more resources), 
  and select <b>Team &gt; Merge...</b> from the pop-up menu.<br>

<h2>Start Point</h2>


<P>This is where you will select the starting point of the merge.
</P>


<P>From the list, select a version of the project that will be the starting
(base) point of the merge operation.
</P>

<h2>End state&nbsp;
</h2>


<P>This is where you will choose the end state of the merge.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</P>


<P>From the list, select either:
</P>


<ul>
  <li>A version of the project</li>
  <li>The branch&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be the end point of the merge operation.&nbsp; Choose a version when 
  you want to merge the differences between two versions of a project into your 
  workspace. Choose a branch if you want to merge the changes made in the branch 
  into your local workspace.</p>

</P>


<P>After the finish button is pressed the changes between the start point and 
  end point are calculated and a merge editor is displayed. Depending on the size 
  of the project you are merging, this may take some time. In the merge editor 
  you can update or merge changes into your Workbench. You cannot commit from 
  the merge view. </P>
