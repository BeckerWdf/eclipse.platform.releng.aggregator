<h1>
Navigate Menu
</h1>
<P CLASS="Intro">
This menu allows you to locate and navigate through resources and other artifacts displayed in the workbench.
<DIV CLASS="Topic">
<h2>
Go Into</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">
This command refocuses the active view so that the current selection is at the root.  This allows web 
browser style navigation within hierarchies of artifacts.
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="Topic">
<h2>
Go To</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">
This submenu contains actions that locate and select objects in the active view.
</P>
<h3>Back</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">
This command refocuses the active view so that it displays the set of artifacts that were visible
before the last use of "Go Into" or "Go Up One Level".  This is analagous to a web browser's "Back" button.
</P>
<h3>Forward</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">
This command refocuses the active view so that it displays the set of artifacts that were visible
before the last use of "Go Back".  This is analagous to a web browser's "Forward" button.
</P>
<h3>Up One Level</h3>
<P CLASS="Para">
This command refocuses the active view so it is rooted at the parent of the current root of the view.  This is
the reverse of the "Go Into" command.
</P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="Topic">
<h2>
Next</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">
This command navigates to the next item in a list or table in the active view.  For example, when the search results view
is active, this navigates to the next search result.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV CLASS="Topic">
<h2>
Previous</h2>
<P CLASS="Para">
This command navigates to the previous item in a list or table in the active view.  For example, when the search results view
is active, this navigates to the previous search result.</P>
