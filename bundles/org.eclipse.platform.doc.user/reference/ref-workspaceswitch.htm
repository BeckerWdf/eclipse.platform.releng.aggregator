<h1>Workspace Switching</h1>
<p>The current workspace for Eclipse can be switched by using the<strong> File-&gt;Switch 
  Workspace </strong>command. If you have already switched your workspace previously 
  the previous workspaces will be available for selection in the Switch Workspace 
  menu.</p>
<p>The Switch Workspace --&gt; Other.. menu item will open the switch workspace 
  dialog. The dialog will allow you to browse for or manually enter a new workspace 
  location. The combo will also allow you to select your previously selected workspaces.</p>
