Refactor menu</h1>

<div CLASS="Head">The goal of refactoring support is to allow for improving
your code without changing its behaviors. When you refactor your code,
your goal is to make a system-wide coding change without affecting the
semantic behavior of the system. The JDT automatically manages refactorings
for you.</div>

<div CLASS="Head"></div>


<p CLASS="Head">The workbench optionally allows you to preview all the
impending results of a refactoring action before you finally choose to
carry it out.
<div CLASS="Head"></div>


<p CLASS="Head">Refactoring commands are available from the context menus
in many views and editors and from the rfactor menu bar.
