    <h1>
      Dialog
    based refactoring user interface</h1>
    <p>
      A dialog based user interface guides you through the steps necessary to execute a selected 
      refactoring. A dialog based refactoring user interface consists of a small first dialog 
      gathering information that is required to execute the refactoring, an separate problem dialog 
      that pops up if any errors are detected and a preview dialog to preview the results of a 
      refactoring.</p>
    <h2>
      Input dialog
    </h2>
    <p>
      This dialog gathers information that is required for the refactoring. For example, a rename 
      refactoring asks you for the new name for the Java element. You can either press <strong>OK
      </strong> to execute the refactoring or <strong>Preview  &gt;</strong> to preview the result
      of the refactoring.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Preview dialog
    </h2>
    <p>
      The JDT allows you to preview the results of a refactoring action before you finally choose 
      to carry it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preview dialog consists of two parts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A tree at the top containing all Java elements affected by the refactoring. Each top-level 
        node in the tree represents one compilation unit.
      </li>
      <li>
        A compare viewer at the bottom. The left side of the compare viewer shows the original, 
        the right side displays the refactored source.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Problem dialog
    </h2>
    <p>
      The problem dialog tells you if there is a suspected, potential, or definite problem with the 
      refactoring action you are attempting to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four kinds of problems are possible:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Information
      </dt>
      <dd>
        These kinds of problems will not affect the refactoring in any way, nor will they negatively affect the code in the workbench. You most likely can ignore these kinds of
        problems.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Warnings
      </dt>
      <dd>
        These kinds of problems attempt to predict compiler warnings. These kinds of problems most likely will not negatively affect the code in your workbench.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Errors
      </dt>
      <dd>
        These kinds of problems are very likely to cause compiler errors or change your workbench code semantically. You can choose to continue with the refactoring despite these
        errors, although it is not recommended.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Stop problems
      </dt>
      <dd>
        These kinds of problems actually prevent the refactoring from taking place at all. For example, if you select a comment and choose the Extract Method command from it, the
        workbench will issue a stop problem on the refactoring attempt because you cannot extract a comment.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      If there aren't any stop problems then the refactoring can be carried out by pressing the <strong>
      OK</strong> button. If you want to preview the results of the refactoring action, press the
      <strong>Continue</strong> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <a href="ref-23.htm">Refactoring preference</a> page (<strong>Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Java</strong> &gt;
      <strong>Refactoring</strong>), you can select the default level for problems to be displayed when you are carrying out a refactoring.
