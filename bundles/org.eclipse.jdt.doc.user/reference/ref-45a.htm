    <h1>
      Open on type
    </h1>
    <p>
      This command opens a Java type in an editor based on content in the console.<br />
      There are two ways this can happen:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If there is an explicit selection in the console, the selected text is parsed for a type name.
      </li>
      <li>
        If there is no selection, but the cursor is placed on a line of output in the console, the entire line is parsed for a type name.
      </li>
    </ol>
    Example: 
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the cursor is placed on the following line of output in the console:<br />
         <em>at com.foo.bar.Application.run(Application.java:58)</em><br />
         An editor for the type com.foo.bar.Application will be opened, and line 58 will be selected and revealed. Note that if the word &#39;Application&#39; had been selected,
        then the user would have been prompted to choose a fully qualified instance of &#39;Application&#39; (if there were more than one in the workspace), and an editor opened
        revealing the beginning of the type.
      </li>
    </ul>
