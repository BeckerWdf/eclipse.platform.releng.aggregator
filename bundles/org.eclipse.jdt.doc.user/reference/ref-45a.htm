This command opens a Java type in an editor based on content in the console.
<br>There are two ways this can happen:
<ol><LI> If there is an explicit selection in the console, the selected text is parsed for a type name.</li>
<li>If there is no selection, but the cursor is placed on a line of output in the console, the entire line is parsed for a type name.</li>
</ol>
Example:
<ul><li>If the cursor is placed on the following line of output in the console:<br>
			<i>at com.foo.bar.Application.run(Application.java:58)</i><br>
 		An editor for the type com.foo.bar.Application will be opened,
 		and line 58 will be selected and revealed.  Note that if the word
 		'Application' had been selected, then the user would have been prompted
 		to choose a fully qualified instance of 'Application' (if
 		there were more than one in the workspace), and an editor opened revealing 
 		the beginning of the type.</li>
 </ul>
