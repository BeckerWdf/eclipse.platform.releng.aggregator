    <ul>
      <li>
        Deleting a field that had a getter and/or a setter prompts you to delete them as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deleting a top-level class prompts you to delete the compilation unit as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        To create a nested type, you can drag-and-drop (either as copy or move) one type to another.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can use Override methods to implement interfaces. Select the type and do one of the following: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Select <strong>Override Methods</strong> from the type&#39;s pop-up menu or
          </li>
          <li>
            Select <strong>Source &gt; Override Method</strong> from the menu bar.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Single method parameters can be renamed like other local variables - by selecting in the editor and executing <strong>Refactor &gt; Rename</strong> from the menu bar or
        pop-up menu.
      </li>
      <li>
        Getters and setters and all references to the getters and the setters can be updated when a field is renamed - to do so, select the field and execute <strong>Refactor &gt;
        Rename</strong> from the menu bar or pop-up menu.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
