<h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p>[This section should make interesting bathroom reading for an end user of
Eclipse 2.1. It should give them bits of advice on how to use Eclipse
effectively. It should stay away for things that a user would naturally discover
while using Eclipse, and instead focus on high-value things that they might not
have noticed. It also differs in tone from the &quot;New for 2.1&quot; section
in that it deals with anything in 2.1, not just the new stuff. Each item should
stand by itself (as they would have to if we had a &quot;Tip of the Day&quot;
facility).]</p>
<p>[Coming soon...this section will be primed with material lifted from the M2
through M5 &quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; bulletins.]</p>
