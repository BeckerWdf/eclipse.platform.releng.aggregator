<h1> Running your programs </h1>
<p> In this section, you will learn more about running Java programs in the workbench. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li> In the Package Explorer view, find <em>junit.textui.TestRunner.java</em> 
    and double-click it to open it in an editor. </li>
  <li> In the Outline view, notice that the TestRunner class has an icon which 
    indicates that this class defines a <code>main</code> method. 
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-58.gif" alt="Outline view with selected TestRunner class"> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> Using the drop-down <strong>Run</strong> button in the toolbar, select 
    <strong>Java Application</strong> from the cascading <strong>Run As</strong> 
    menu. This will launch the class in the active editor, or the selected class 
    in the Navigator, as a local Java application. 
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-59.gif" alt="Run drop down menu"> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Notice that the program has run and the following message appears in the 
    Console view telling you that the program needs an execution argument. 
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-60.gif" alt="Console with error message: Usage: TestRunner [-wait] testCaseName, where name is the name of the TestCase class"> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> Using the drop-down <strong>Run</strong> menu in the toolbar, select <strong>Run...</strong>. 
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-61.gif" alt="Run menu of the toolbar"> </p>
  </li>
  <li> The Launch Configurations dialog opens, and the TestRunner launch configuration 
    is selected. When you ran the program using the Java Application shortcut, 
    a launch configuration was automatically created with default settings to 
    launch the selected class. 
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-62.gif" alt="Launch configuration dialog showing the Main tab"> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> Select the Arguments tab and type <em>junit.samples.VectorTest</em> in 
    the Program arguments area. 
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-63.gif" alt="Arguments tab of the launch configuration dialog"> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> Click <strong>Run</strong>. This time the program runs correctly, indicating 
    the number of tests that were run. 
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-64.gif" alt="Console showing program output"> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Switch to the Debug perspective. In the Debug view, notice that a launch 
    was registered each time the program was run.

    </p>
    <em>Note: You can relaunch any of these processes by selecting <strong>Relaunch</strong> 
    from its context menu.</em> </li>
  <li> Select the drop-down menu from the <strong>Run</strong> button in the workbench 
    toolbar. This list contains the previously launched configurations. Configurations 
    can be relaunched by selecting them in this history list as well. 
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-66.gif" alt="Run drop down menu from the workbench toolbar"> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> From the context menu in the Debug view (or the equivalent toolbar button), 
    select <strong>Remove All Terminated</strong> to clear the view of terminated 
    launches.
