<h1> Debugging your programs </h1>
<p> In this section, you will debug a Java program. </p>
<ol>
  <li> In the Package Explorer view in the Java perspective, double-click <em>junit.samples.VectorTest.java</em> 
    to open it in an editor. </li>
  <li> Place your cursor on the marker bar (along the left edge of the editor 
    area) on the following line in the setUp() method: 
    <p> <code>fFull.addElement (new Integer(1));</code> </p>
    <p> and double-click to set a breakpoint. </p>
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-68.gif" alt="VectorTest.java editor showing added breakpoint"> 
    </p>
    <em>Note: The breakpoint is blue with no checkmark overlay as the breakpoint 
    is not yet installed, meaning that the containing class has not yet been loaded 
    by the Java VM.</em> </li>
  <li> In the Package Explorer view, select the <em>junit.samples</em> package 
    and select the Run menu. Within the Run menu, select Debug As, and then Java 
    Application. </li>
  <li> Select the <em>VectorTest - junit.samples - /JUnit</em> item in the dialog, 
    then click <strong>Finish</strong>. 
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-69.gif" alt="Type selection dialog"> </p>
  </li>
  <li> As soon as the breakpoint is hit, the Debug perspective opens, and execution 
    is suspended. Notice that the process is still active (not terminated) in 
    the Debug view. Other threads might still be running. 
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-70.gif" alt="Debug perspective"> </p>
    <em>Note: The breakpoint has an overlay icon of a checkmark because it is 
    now installed (VectorTest has been loaded in the Java VM).</em> </li>
  <li> In the editor in the Debug perspective, select the entire line where the 
    breakpoint is set, and from its context menu, select <strong>Inspect</strong>. 
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-71.gif" alt="VectorTest.java editor with selected breakpoint line showing context menu"> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> The expression is evaluated in the context of the current stack frame, 
    and the results are displayed in the Expressions view. Select the expression 
    in the Expressions view, and from its context menu, select <strong>Remove</strong>. 
  </li>
  <li> The Variables view displays the values of the variables in the selected 
    stack frame. Expand the fFull tree in the Variables view until you can see 
    elementCount. 
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-72.gif" alt="Variables view"> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Watch the variables (e.g., elementCount) in the Variables view as you step 
    through VectorTest in the Debug view: 
    <p> Click the <strong>Step Over</strong> button to step over the highlighted 
      line of code. Execution will continue at the next line in the same method 
      (or, if you are at the end of a method, it will continue in the method from 
      which the current method was called). </p>
    <p> Note: The variables that are changed as a result of the last step are 
      highlighted in the color specified in the Debug Variable Views &quot;Changed 
      Variable Value Color&quot; preference (the default color is red). </p>
    <p> <img src="../images/qs-73.gif" alt="TestCase.java editor showing current line of execution"> 
    </p>
  </li>
  <li> If the program has not executed fully when you are done debugging, select 
    <strong>Terminate</strong> from the context menu of the program&#39;s launch 
    item in the Debug view. </li>
