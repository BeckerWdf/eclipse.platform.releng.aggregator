      Adding new methods
    </h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start adding a method by typing the following at the end of the <em>VectorTest.java</em> file (but before the closing 
        brackets of the type) in the Java editor:<br>
        <code>public void testSizeIsThree()</code><br>
		As soon as you type the method name in the editor area, the new method appears at the bottom of the Outline view. 
		<p>

		</p>
		In addition, an error annotation (red square) appears in the overview ruler positioned on the right hand side 
		of the editor. This error annotation indicates that the compilation unit is currently not correct. If you hover
		over the red square a tool tip appears, <em>Unmatched bracket</em>; <em>Syntax error on token &quot;)&quot;, 
		&quot;{&quot; expected</em>, which is correct since the method doesn't have a body yet. Note that error 
		annotations in the editor's rulers are updated as you type. This behavior can be controlled via  <STRONG>Analyze
	annotations while typing</STRONG> option located on the preference page <strong>Java &gt; 
		Editor</strong>  under the <STRONG>Typing</STRONG> tab .
		<p>

		</p>
		
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <strong>Save</strong> button. The compilation unit is compiled automatically and errors appear in the 
        Package Explorer view, in the Problems view and on the vertical ruler (left hand side of the editor). In the Package 
        Explorer view, the errors are propagated up to the project of the compilation unit containing the error.

      </li>
      <li>
        Complete the new method by typing the following:<br>
        <p><code>
          {<br>
          &nbsp; assertTrue(fFull.size() == 3);<br>
        </code></p>
        Note, that the closing curly bracket has been auto inserted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Save the file. Notice that the error indicators disappear since the
        missing bracket has been added.
      </li>
    </ol>
