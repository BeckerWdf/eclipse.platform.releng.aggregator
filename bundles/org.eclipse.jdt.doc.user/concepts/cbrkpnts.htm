    <h1>Breakpoints</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A breakpoint suspends the execution of a program at the location where the breakpoint is set.</p>

    <p>Breakpoints can be enabled and disabled via the context menu in the Breakpoints view.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>When a breakpoint is enabled, it will cause a thread to suspend whenever
        the breakpoint is reached. Enabled breakpoints are indicated with a blue circle and
        are shown with a checkmark overlay once successfully installed. A breakpoint can only
        be installed when the class the breakpoint is located in has been loaded in the VM.</li>

      <li>When a breakpoint is disabled, it will not cause threads to suspend. Disabled breakpoints are indicated with a white circle.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Breakpoints are displayed in the vertical editor ruler and in the Breakpoints view.</p>
