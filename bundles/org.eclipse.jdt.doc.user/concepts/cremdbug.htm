    <h1>
      Remote debugging
    </h1>
    <p>
      It is possible to connect to and debug a Java program that has been launched in debug mode configured to accept connections on a remote or local host. Debugging a remote
      program is similar to debugging a regular Java program, except that the program has already been launched and could be on a remote host. <a href="clocdbug.htm">See Debugging
      Locally</a>
    </p>
    <p class="Note">
      Note: Launching a Java program in debug mode is VM-specific.
