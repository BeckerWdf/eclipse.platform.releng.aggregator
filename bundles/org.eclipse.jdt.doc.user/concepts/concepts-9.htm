  <h1>Refactoring support</h1>
  <p class="para">The goal of refactoring is to improve source code without changing 
    its behavior. Refactoring means behavior-preserving program transformation. 
    When you refactor your code, your goal is to make a system-wide code change 
    without affecting the behavior of the system. The JDT helps you automatically 
    manage refactorings.</p>
  <p class="para">The JDT supports a number of transformations described in Martin 
    Fowler's book <span class="title1"><i>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing 
    Code</i></span>, Addison Wesley 1999.</p>
  <p class="para">When performing a refactoring operation, you can optionally preview 
    all the impending changes resulting from a refactoring action before you finally 
    choose to carry them out. Thus, you can execute a refactoring in one of two 
    different ways: </p>
  <ul type="Disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; "><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; ">Refactoring without preview<br>
      In a quick refactoring, you skip being notified of potential problems and 
      the refactoring preview. If a Stop problem is detected, the refactoring 
      will not be carried out.</span></li>
    <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; "><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; ">Refactoring with preview<br>
      In a controlled refactoring, you are notified of potential problems and 
      are given a detailed preview of what the refactoring action will do.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Refactoring commands are available from the context menus in may views and 
    editors.</p>
