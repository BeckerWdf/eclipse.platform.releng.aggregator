    <h1>
      Using breakpoints
    </h1>
    <p>
      A breakpoint causes the execution of a thread or virtual machine to suspend at the location where the breakpoint is set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakpoints can be enabled and disabled via their context menus in the Breakpoints view.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When a breakpoint is enabled, it will cause a thread to suspend whenever it is hit. Enabled breakpoints are indicated with a blue circle. Enabled breakpoints that are
        successfully installed in a class in a VM at runtime are indicated with a checkmark overlay.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a breakpoint is disabled, it will not cause threads to suspend. Disabled breakpoints are indicated with a white circle.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Debugging breakpoints are displayed in the marker bar in the editor area and in the Breakpoints view.
