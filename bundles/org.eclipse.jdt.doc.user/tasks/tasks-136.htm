    <h1>
      Stepping through the execution of a Java program
    </h1>
    <p>
      When a thread is suspended, the step controls can be used to step through the execution of the program line-by-line. While performing a step operation, if a breakpoint is
      encountered, execution suspends at the breakpoint, and the step operation ends.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Step over
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select a stack frame in the Debug view. The current line of execution in that stack frame is highlighted in the editor in the Debug perspective.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <strong><span class="Label">Step Over</span></strong> button in the Debug view toolbar, or press the <strong>F6</strong> key. The currently-selected line is
        executed and suspends on the next executable line.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      Step into
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select a stack frame in the Debug view. The current line of execution in the selected frame is highlighted in the editor in the Debug perspective.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <strong><span class="Label">Step Into</span></strong> button in the Debug view toolbar, or press the <strong>F5</strong> key. The next expression on the
        currently-selected line to be executed is invoked, and execution suspends at the next executable line in the method that is invoked.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      Run to return
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Select a stack frame in the Debug view. The current line of execution in the selected frame is highlighted in the editor in the Debug perspective.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the <strong><span class="Label">Run to Return</span></strong> button in the Debug view toolbar or press the <strong>F7</strong> key. Execution resumes until the next
        return statement in the current method is executed, and execution suspends on the next executable line.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      Run to line
    </h2>
    <p>
      When a thread is suspended, it is possible to resume execution until a specified line is executed. This is a convenient way to suspend execution at a line without setting a
      breakpoint.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place your cursor on the line at which you want the program to run and select <strong><span class="Label">Run to Line</span></strong> from the pop-up menu or use
        <strong>Ctrl+R</strong>. Program execution is resumed and suspends just before the specified line is to be executed.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is possible that the line will never be hit and that the program will not suspend. Breakpoints and exceptions cause a thread to suspend before reaching the specified
        line.
      </li>
    </ol>
