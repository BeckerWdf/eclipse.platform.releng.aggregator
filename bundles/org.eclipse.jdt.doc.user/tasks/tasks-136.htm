Stepping through the execution of a Java program</H1>
<P CLASS="Para">
When a thread is suspended, the step controls can be used to step through the execution of the program line-by-line. While performing a step operation, if a breakpoint is encountered, execution suspends at the breakpoint, and the step operation ends.</P>
<h2>
Step over</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Select a stack frame in the Debug view.
The current line of execution in that stack frame is highlighted in the editor in the Debug perspective.</li>
  <li>Click the <b> <SPAN CLASS="Label">
Step Over</SPAN></b>
 button in the Debug view toolbar, or press the <b>F6</b> key.
The currently-selected line is executed and suspends on the next executable line.</li>
</ol>
<h2>
Step into</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Select a stack frame in the Debug view.
The current line of execution in the selected frame is highlighted in the editor in the Debug perspective.</li>
  <li>Click the <b> <SPAN CLASS="Label">
Step Into</SPAN></b>
 button in the Debug view toolbar, or press the <b>F5</b> key.
The next expression on the currently-selected line to be executed is invoked, and execution suspends at the next executable line in the method that is invoked.</li>
</ol>
<h2>
Run to return</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Select a stack frame in the Debug view.
The current line of execution in the selected frame is highlighted in the editor in the Debug perspective.</li>
  <li>Click the <b> <SPAN CLASS="Label">
Run to Return</SPAN></b>
 button in the Debug view toolbar or press the <b>F7</b> key.
Execution resumes until the next return statement in the current method is executed, and execution suspends on the next executable line.</li>
</ol>
<h2>
Run to line</h2>
<P>
When a thread is suspended, it is possible to resume execution until a specified line is executed. This is a convenient way to suspend execution at a line without setting a breakpoint.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Place your cursor on the line at which you want the program to run and select
  <b> <SPAN CLASS="Label">
Run to Line</SPAN></b>
 from the pop-up menu or use<b>Ctrl+R</b>.
Program execution is resumed and suspends just before the specified line is to be executed.</li>
  <li>It is possible that the line will never be hit and that the program will not suspend. Breakpoints and exceptions cause a thread to suspend before reaching the specified line.</li>
</ol>
