      Navigating packages
    </h1>
    <p>
      The Package Explorer that is shown by default in the Java perspective shows the Java element hierarchy of the Java projects in your workbench. It provides you with a
      Java-specific view of the resources shown in the Navigator. The element hierarchy is derived from the project&#39;s build paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each project, its source folders and referenced libraries are shown in the tree. You can open and browse the contents of both internal and external JAR files. Opening a
      Java element inside a JAR opens the CLASS file editor, and if there is a source attachment for the JAR file, its corresponding source is shown.
