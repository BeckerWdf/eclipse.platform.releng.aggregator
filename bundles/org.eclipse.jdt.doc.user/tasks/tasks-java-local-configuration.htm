    <h1>
      Creating a local Java application launch configuration
    </h1>
    <p>
      You can use launch configurations to control various aspects of launching a Java application. The <strong>Java Application</strong> launch configuration type is used to
      launch local Java applications. Java application launch configurations can be launched in run or debug mode.
    </p>
    <ol class="UnorderedList">
      <li>
        From the <strong>Run</strong> menu, or the <strong>Debug</strong> drop down menu, select <strong>Debug...</strong>. This opens the launch configuration dialog, where
        launch configurations can be created, modified, and deleted. 
        <p>
          NOTE: Selecting <strong>Run...</strong> from the <strong>Run</strong> menu or <strong>Run</strong> drop down menu has the same effect.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Select <strong>Java Application</strong> in the left hand list of launch configuration types, and press <strong>New</strong>. This will create a new launch configuration
        for a local Java application. The newly created launch configuration will be populated with default values for launching the selected resource in the workbench (if any).
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>Main</strong> tab defines the class to be launched. Enter the name of the project containing the class to launch in the project field, and the fully
          qualified name of the main class in the the Main class field.
        </p>
        <p>
          NOTE: A project does not have to be specified, but when a project is specified, it is used to calculate a default classpath, source lookup path, and JRE used to run or
          debug the application.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>Arguments</strong> tab defines the arguments to be passed to the application and to the virtual machine (if any). As well, the working directory to be used
          by the launched application can be defined here.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>JRE</strong> tab defines the JRE used to run or debug the application. This tab allows you to select from the already defined JREs, and allows you to define
          new JREs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>Classpath</strong> tab defines the location of class files used when running or debugging an application. By default, the user and bootstrap class locations
          are derived from the associated project&#39;s build path. However, these settings may be overridden if required.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>Source</strong> tab defines the location of source files used to display source when debugging a Java application. By default, these settings are derived
          from the associated project&#39;s build path. However, these settings may be overridden if required.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>Common</strong> tab defines the location of the launch configuration itself. By default, a launch configuration is stored as a file, locally with the
          workspace meta data. However, a launch configuration may also be stored as a file in the workspace. This tab also controls which perspective becomes active when the
          launch configuration is launched in run or debug mode.
        </p>
