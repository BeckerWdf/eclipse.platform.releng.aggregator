Deadlines:
  Thursday, 1/28, around 5 PM (Eastern): deadline for sign-off (or, by then, comment in this bug when you expect to sign-off).
  Friday, 1/29, afternoon: promote approved build to M-4.5RC2-201601271000, contribute to simultaneous release repo, and announce to our mailing lists.

Remember to investigate and document here any failing JUnit tests. 

Also, remember, we will rebuild at 8 PM Thursday (Eastern time) to pick up version fixes (bug 486616). 
Only version fixes should go into the re-build without announcement (though, please comment in bug 486616).
Any other fixes should have proper approval and be announced on platform-releng-dev list. (Thanks)
