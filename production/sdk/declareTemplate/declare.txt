Declare Mars.1 RC3

A "go" is needed from all components below to declare the release candidate.

Current available build: 
Note: Below I have put "Final Candidate" as what the final candidate should be, 
which is still building (seems to have "hung up" on generating JavaDoc, but the performance 
tests from earlier build have recently finished, so hope it makes more progress now). 
Until that final build is done, I think the "latest available build" will be 
suitable for most to test -- with perhaps the exception of anything p2 related 
(since ECF was the only change, in final build). 

Plus, I MIGHT have to restart the final build, with more memory allocated to max heap.
(See bug 476493). So, I don't think everyone *has* to wait for the final build 
(but, others can correct me, if it is thought to be important). 

So, that "currently available" build is 
http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/M20150902-1200/

The (probable) 
Final candidate:
