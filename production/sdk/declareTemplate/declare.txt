Declare Luna RC1

(See bug 433882 for M7 declare.)

A "go" is needed from all components below to declare the release candidate. 

While tests are won't be finished until "this evening", 
Be sure to comment on failing JUnit tests, if any, including the bug number used to track it. 

Deadlines: 

Since "final build" was late (bug 434959) I've extended the normal "sign-off" deadline.

Friday, 05/17, around 12 noon (Eastern), deadline for official sign-off (or, let us know when you expect to finish). 

Friday, 05/17, afternoon, 
promote approved build to Luna "S-build" and contribute to simultaneous release repo, and announce to our mailing lists.
