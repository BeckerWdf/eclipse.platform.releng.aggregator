This is the psuedo code for doing the "second step" (making visible, at the right time, etc.)
The same part of the code than generates the "checklist" and other "deferred execution" files, 
could generate this one too. 


# step 2

# equinox is only promoted every 30 mintues ... so should do close to the hour, or half hour, 
# without looking too badly out of sync.
mv /shared/eclipse/equinox/promotion/queue/manual-LunaSR1RC4.sh /shared/eclipse/equinox/promotion/queue/promote-LunaSR1RC4.sh
 
mv /home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/M-4.4.1RC4-201409102310/buildHidden /home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/M-4.4.1RC4-201409102310/buildHiddenORIG

# variable step (though, guess it doesn't hurt to alway do it?) 
touch /home/data/httpd/download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/M-4.4.1RC4-201409102310/overrideTestColor

/shared/eclipse/sdk/updateIndexes.sh
 
 
 # assuming in the promoteLuna, or promoteMars directory
./deferedCompositeAdd.sh

./deferedTag.sh

# In theory could automate the "announce" mail too ... but, doesn't hurt to give everyone a 'sanity check' anyway, before 
# sending mail, so ... not that useful?
