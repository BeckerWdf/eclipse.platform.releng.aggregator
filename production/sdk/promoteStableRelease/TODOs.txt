during M3. 

A. The (deferred) make composite task had "way wrong" values for "base" and "co-located" to add. 
   (I did copy that script, so need to standarize on variable name). 
   
B. Equinox needs re-design with "buildHidden". 
  
   If hidden
   
      still produce 'promote-site.sh' to rcync it up there, -- named  "promote-..."
      and also create a second one
      to "rm -vf build hidden file. -- named "manual-promote-rm-...
