This zip file contains the config.xml files from the "old" 
shared Hudson instance. 

These were all the jobs in the "Eclipse and Equinox" view. 

They (likely) can never be used "as is", but might help know how to configure 
old jobs, such as for "Y-builds", etc., if ever needed. 

These can be discarded after some period of time. Say, after one year. August 2016, if 
there is ever a need to "clean up" Git repo.
