The RCP downloads are meant as a base for building Eclipse RCP applications.  
As such, they do not include an application of their own and simply running the 
RCP install will do nothing.

Eclipse 3.2 requires Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or higher and Java 1.4.2 or higher.
Since M5 Eclipse supports the Intel architecture.

Please use BOMArchiveHelper if StuffIt fails to extract the downloaded tar.gz (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=131650).
