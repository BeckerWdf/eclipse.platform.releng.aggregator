This is a very experimental build of the Mac OSX port.  It is being generated as we attempt
to get the automated Mac build process working.  This process will, hopefully, be complete in
a couple of days.

At this point please report any problems related to the build to the
platform-releng-dev@eclipse.org mailing list.


Important note about unpacking Eclipse on MacOS X:

Out of the box, Zip files are unzipped using Stuffit Expander,
which does not handle the long filenames that the Eclipse build uses.
It ends up truncating them, which causes numerous problems.

Furthermore, Mac users use IE 5.2 by default, and the download manager will by default
automatically unzip downloads using this mechanism.
In addition IE 5.2 does not preserve the long file name of the Eclipse Zip archive,
so it ends up in "eclipse-SDK-I20020917-macosx-ca".


How to unzip the build yourself:

Assuming you download to the desktop, 
from a terminal window:

cd ~/desktop
unzip eclipse-SDK-I20020917-macosx-ca
