Note: Carbon is no longer a reference platform for the Eclipse 3.7 release,
and will not be produced for releases after 3.7. We suggest you switch to the
Cocoa port.

This version of Eclipse requires Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) or higher, and Java 1.4.2 to Java
1.5.x.  

Please use BOMArchiveHelper if StuffIt fails to extract the downloaded tar.gz
(https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=131650).

In order to use the SWT_AWT bridge, OS X jre version 1.5.0 Release 5
(or greater) must be used.
