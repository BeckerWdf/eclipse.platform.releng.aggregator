n order for this version of Eclipse to run, GTK2 libraries must be installed
and available on the library path (i.e. LD_LIBRARY_PATH).

To prevent errors with workspace locking, the following command line should be
used to launch Eclipse:

"eclipse -vmargs -Dosgi.locking=none"

Otherwise, eclipse may fail to create a lock file with reason: "Workspace in use or cannot be created, choose a different one."
