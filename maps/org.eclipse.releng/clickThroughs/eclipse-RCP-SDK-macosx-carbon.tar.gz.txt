The RCP downloads are meant as a base for building Eclipse RCP applications.  
As such, they do not include an application of their own and simply running the 
RCP install will do nothing.

Please use BOMArchiveHelper if StuffIt fails to extract the downloaded tar.gz
(https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=131650).

A: In order to use the SWT_AWT bridge, a supporting OS X jre must be used as well.
Specifically, the jre must be version 1.5.0 Release 4 (or greater), and the
additional "SWT Compatibility Libraries" must be installed.  These libraries can
be downloaded from the Downloads section of
<a href="http://connect.apple.com">Apple Developer Connection</a>.  It's free to
create an account at Apple Developer Connection to access the download, which is
approximately 180K.  (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=67384">bug 67384</a>).
