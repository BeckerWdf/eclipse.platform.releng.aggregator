A: In order to use the SWT_AWT bridge, a supporting OS X jre must be used as well.
Specifically, the jre must be version 1.5.0 Release 4 (or greater), and the
additional "SWT Compatibility Libraries" must be installed.  These libraries can
be downloaded from the Downloads section of
<a href="http://connect.apple.com">Apple Developer Connection</a>.  It's free to
create an account at Apple Developer Connection to access the download, which is
approximately 180K.  (<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=67384">bug 67384</a>).
