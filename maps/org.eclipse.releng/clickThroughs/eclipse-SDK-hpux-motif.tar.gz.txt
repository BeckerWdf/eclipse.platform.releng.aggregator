You will need gnu tar (http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/tar.html)
to extract the eclipse tar.gz file.
See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=82568
for further details.

On HP-UX, the JVM process that runs the Eclipse Workbench does not terminate 
upon closing the workbench. This can be fixed by passing the
-XdoCloseWithReadPending VM option to the Eclipse launcher. For example, you 
could launch eclipse as follows: "eclipse -vmargs -XdoCloseWithReadPending".
