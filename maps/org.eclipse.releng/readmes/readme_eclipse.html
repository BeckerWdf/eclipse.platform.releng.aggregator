<h2>1. <a name="Target Operating Environments"></a> Target Operating
Environments</h2>
<p>Most of the Eclipse SDK is &quot;pure&quot; Java™ code and has no direct
dependence on the underlying operating system. The chief dependence is therefore
on the Java 2 Platform itself. Like the 2.0 release, the 2.1 release of the
Eclipse Project is written and compiled against version 1.3 of the Java 2
Platform APIs, and targeted to run on either version 1.3 or 1.4 of the Java 2
Runtime Environment, Standard Edition.</p>
<p>Eclipse SDK 2.1 has been tested and validated on the following Java 2
Platform implementations:</p>

<h4>Internationalization</h4>
<p>The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for internationalized products.
The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, including
dialogs and error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided
as the default resource bundles.</p>
<p>Latin-1 locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on all of the above
operating environments; DBCS locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on the
Windows, GTK, and Motif window systems; BIDI locales are supported by the
Eclipse SDK only on Windows operating environments.
<p>The Eclipse SDK supports GB 18030, the new Chinese code page standard, on
Windows 2000 and XP, and Linux. Note, however, that GB 18030 also requires
locale and character encoding support from the Java 2 Runtime Environment; this
support is standard in version 1.4, and also available in some 1.3 JREs.
<p>German and Japanese locales have been tested.
<h4>BIDI support</h4>
<p>The Eclipse SDK is a development environment targeted at technical
professionals - not an end user application. However, the Eclipse SDK tools will
permit technical professionals who are working in English to build Hebrew/Arabic
end user Java programs which are themselves not based on the Eclipse SDK. The
BIDI support in the Eclipse SDK allows a Java programmer to work with BIDI
strings, code comments, etc. but the Eclipse SDK itself is not designed to be
localized for BIDI locales and its widget orientation cannot be changed.</p>
<p><i>IMPORTANT: The above BIDI support is available only for Windows operating
environments.</i></p>
<h2>2. <a name="Compatibility with Previous Release"></a> Compatibility with
Previous Releases</h2>
<h3>Compatibility of Release 2.1 with 2.0</h3>
Eclipse SDK 2.1 is intended to be upwards compatible with Eclipse SDK 2.0. We
have made exceptions only in areas where slavishly maintaining compatibility
would not be in the best interests of Eclipse or its clients. The exceptions are
noted in the next section.
<p><b>API Contract Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 2.1 is upwards
contract-compatible with Eclipse SDK 2.0 except as noted in the next section.
This means that programs in full compliance with contracts specified in Eclipse
SDK 2.0 APIs is automatically in full compliance with Eclipse SDK 2.1 APIs. (API
is construed broadly to include such things as plug-in extension points.)
Downward contract compatibility is not supported. There is no guarantee that
compliance with Eclipse SDK 2.1 APIs ensures compliance with Eclipse SDK 2.0
APIs. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that
maintain contract compatibility.</p>
<p><b>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 2.1 is upwards
binary-compatible with Eclipse SDK 2.0 except as noted in the next section. This
means that plug-ins built for Eclipse SDK 2.0 will continue to work correctly in
Eclipse SDK 2.1 without change. Downward plug-in compatibility is not supported.
Plug-ins for Eclipse SDK 2.1 are unlikely to be usable in Eclipse SDK 2.0.
Plug-ins with hard-coded references in their plug-in manifest file to 2.0
versions of prerequisite Eclipse Project plug-ins will work in 2.1 provided the
version match rule is &quot;greaterOrEqual&quot; or &quot;compatible&quot; (the
default); references using &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;equivalent&quot; match
rules will be broken. Refer to <i><a href="http://eclipse.org/eclipse/development/java-api-evolution.html">Evolving
Java-based APIs</a></i> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that
maintain binary compatibility.
<p><b>Source Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 2.1 is upwards source-compatible
with Eclipse SDK 2.0 except as noted in the next section. This means that source
files written to use Eclipse SDK 2.0 APIs can be successfully compiled and run
against Eclipse SDK 2.1 APIs. Since source incompatibilities are easy to deal
with, maintaining source compatibility is considered much less important than
maintaining contract and binary compatibility. Downward source compatibility is
not supported. If source files use new Eclipse SDK APIs, they will not be usable
with an earlier version of Eclipse SDK.
<p><b>Workspace Compatibility:</b> Eclipse SDK 2.1 is upwards
workspace-compatible with Eclipse SDK 2.0 except as noted in the next section.
This means that workspaces and projects created with Eclipse SDK 2.0 can be
successfully opened by Eclipse SDK 2.1 and upgraded to a 2.1 workspace.&nbsp;
This includes both hidden metadata, which is localized to a particular
workspace, as well as metadata files found within a workspace project (e.g., the
.project file), which may propagate between workspaces via file copying or team
repositories. Individual plug-ins developed for Eclipse SDK 2.1 should provide
similar upwards compatibility for their hidden and visible workspace metadata
created by earlier versions; 2.1 plug-in developers are responsible for ensuring
that their plug-ins recognize both 2.1 and 2.0 metadata and process it
appropriately. User interface session state may be discarded when a workspace is
upgraded. Downward workspace compatibility is not supported. A workspace created
(or opened) by Eclipse SDK 2.1 will be unusable with an earlier version of
Eclipse SDK. Visible metadata files created (or overwritten) by Eclipse SDK 2.1
will generally be unusable with earlier versions of Eclipse SDK.&nbsp;
<p><b>Non-compliant usage of API's</b>: All non-API methods and classes, and
certainly everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name, are
considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment
and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend
on anything other than what is specified in the Eclipse SDK API are inherently
unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single
release much less with an earlier release. Refer to <i><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">How
to Use the Eclipse API</a></i> for information about how to write compliant
plug-ins.</p>
<h3>2.1 Incompatibilities between release 2.1 and 2.0</h3>
<p>Eclipse 2.1 breaks compatibility with Eclipse 2.0 in the following areas.</p>
<p>Note: Bug numbers refer to the Eclipse project bug database at <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/">http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/</a></p>
<h3>Platform - Core</h3>
<h4>Linked resources</h4>
<p>Eclipse 2.1 allows a project in the workspace to bring together contents from
several different directories on disk using what are termed linked folders and
files. The presence of linked resources changes a fundamental assumption true
for earlier versions of Eclipse, namely, that all of a project's files are
located under the project's root directory in the local file system.
Furthermore, the target of a linked resource is allowed to overlap that of
another linked resource, or overlap the root directory of any project. This new
potential for overlap means that several distinct files in the workspace might
map to the same file in the local file system. In 2.0, there was no way for
overlap to happen (project root directories are not allowed to overlap).</p>
<p>These changes have several ramifications at the API:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>IResource.getLocation</code> can return <code>null</code> in more
    cases than before.</li>
  <li><code>IWorkspaceRoot.getContainerForLocation</code> and <code>getFileForLocation</code>
    are no longer sufficient to map from file system path to workspace path in
    the presence of linked resources, as these calls do not account for linked
    files or files under linked folders. Two new methods were added to handle
    the possibility of overlap: <code>IWorkspaceRoot.findContainersForLocation</code>
    and <code>findFilesForLocation</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since linked resources and their children appear in the workspace as normal
files and folders, client code that works exclusively with the workspace
resource tree is not affected. The clients most likely to be impacted are ones
that assume that all of a project's files are located together in the local file
system under the project's root directory. For example, an export utility that
works directly on the local file system might miss some of a project's files if
it only looks within the project's root directory.</p>
<p>This change was made to give certain kinds of users greater flexibility in
laying out their projects on disk. The behavior of existing plug-ins is
unchanged from 2.0 for projects that do not use linked resources. Depending on
the assumptions made, existing plug-ins might misbehave or fail for projects
containing linked resources. A plug-in can prohibit linked resources for a
project via a project nature (<code>IProjectNatureDescriptor.isLinkingAllowed()</code>),
but this should only be done where there is a good reason to deny the user this
additional flexibility in laying out a project. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=6664">6664</a>)</p>
<h4>Project build order</h4>
<p>The default order in which projects get built was changed in Eclipse 2.1 to
improve the handling of mutually-dependent projects. The old method <code>IWorkspace.computePrerequisiteOrder</code>
was deprecated and replaced by <code>IWorkspace.computeProjectOrder</code>.
Since there are few potential clients of either method beyond the Eclipse
Platform itself, it's unlikely that clients will be affected. (bugs <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=10262">10262</a>,
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25952">25952</a>)</p>
<h3>Platform - UI</h3>
<h4>Restructuring of UI plug-ins</h4>
<p>In Eclipse 2.1, the API and code for the <code>org.eclipse.ui</code> plug-in
was partitioned and parceled out to several new plug-ins (<code>org.eclipse.jface</code>,
<code>org.eclipse.text</code>, and <code>org.eclipse.ui.workbench</code>, etc.).
Although this looks on the surface to be a breaking change, it is not. These new
plug-ins are internal and should not be referenced explicitly. As they always
have, plug-ins requiring the Eclipse Platform UI (API found in the <code>org.eclipse.swt.*</code>,
<code>org.eclipse.jface.*</code>, and <code>org.eclipse.ui.*</code> packages)
should continue to state a dependency on the <code>org.eclipse.ui</code>
plug-in.</p>
<h3>Platform - Help</h3>
<h4>Pluggable app server</h4>
<p>Eclipse 2.0 provided interim support for pluggable app servers via an
undocumented <code>org.eclipse.help.app-server</code> extension point, with
interim APIs in the <code>org.eclipse.help</code> package. For 2.1, this support
has been made internal, along with the former interim API classes. Because this
support was marked as interim for 2.0, this is not really a breaking API change.
Nevertheless, existing clients using the interim support will be broken. Even
though the mechanism is not officially supported, clients that are adamant about
plugging in a different app server can do so (with all the usual risks of
depending on unsupported Eclipse internals).</p>
<h4>Pluggable web browser</h4>
<p>Eclipse 2.0 provided interim support for pluggable web browsers via the <code>org.eclipse.help.ui.browser</code>
extension point, with API in the <code>org.eclipse.help.ui.browser</code>
package. For 2.1, this support appears in finished form in different location:
the <code>org.eclipse.help.browser</code> extension point, with API in the <code>org.eclipse.help.browser</code>
package. Because this support was marked as interim for 2.0, this is not really
a breaking change. Nevertheless, existing clients using the interim support will
need to update the extension point and package names.</p>
<h3>Platform - Team</h3>
<b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p>Validate edit/save</p>
</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">
<p>There are some new restrictions that repository providers should be aware of
when implementing <code>validateSave/Edit</code>. The first is that the hook can
be invoked from a non-UI thread. The provider should use <code>Display.syncExec()</code>
if they are affecting any UI components. Also, the hook should not display a
progress monitor because there is a good possibility that there already is one
open for the operation being performed; and opening another will cause deadlock.
(bug <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=33471">33471</a>)</p>
<b>
<p>Linked resources</p>
</b>
<p>The new support for linked files and folders added in Eclipse 2.1 impacts
repository providers because it changes some of the rules about relationships
between files in the workspace and their corresponding locations in the local
file system. All existing repository providers should be updated to handle
linked resources, as described in the 2.1 Team API. </font>I<font face="Times New Roman">f
a project is shared via an older 2.0 repository provider, the user will simply
be able to create linked resources in that project.</font> <font face="Times New Roman">(bug
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=26469">26469</a>)</p>
</font>
<h3>Platform - SWT</h3>
<h4>Character field in key event</h4>
<p>The specification of the <code>Event.character</code> field now makes it
clear that the character reflects the outcome after any modifier keys are taken
into account (for example, CTRL+A is reduced to the ASCII equivalent character
with integer value 1). Since the treatment of modifier keys was completely
unspecified before, this change affects clients that make assumptions about how
modifiers were handled. (bug <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=33592">33592</a>)</p>
<h4>New key modifier: command</h4>
<p>In order to properly support the Mac for Eclipse 2.1, a new <code>SWT.COMMAND
</code>key modifier constant was added to represent the Apple command key. On
the Mac, the command key plays the same role as the control key plays elsewhere,
whereas the control key is used mainly as an additional mouse click modifier.
Clients that merely want to check for the appropriate primary modifier for the
OS should instead use the new bit mask <code>SWT.MOD1</code> in favor of either <code>SWT.CONTROL</code>
or <code>SWT.COMMAND</code>. The advent of the Mac port of Eclipse affects
existing clients that explicitly check for the <code>SWT.CONTROL</code>
modifier. In most cases, they should instead check for <code>SWT.MOD1</code> so
that they work appropriately on both Macs and non-Macs. (bug <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=24393">24393</a>)</p>
<h4>OLE variant type exceptions</h4>
<p>An <code>SWTError</code> exception is now thrown when a Java type is
requested from an empty variant type (<code>VT_EMPTY</code>). Since existing
clients should already be handling <code>SWTError</code> exceptions as per the
spec for <code>Variant.getInt()</code>, etc., this change should not affect
existing clients. (bug <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=24402">24402</a>)</p>
<h4>Multiple drag and drop adapters</h4>
<p>An <code>SWTError</code> exception is now thrown if you create a second <code>DragSource</code>
(or <code>DropTarget</code>) for a widget. Across various window systems, the
results of creating multiple drag source or drop target objects were at best
indeterminate. The exception makes it clear that this is not supported. Since
existing clients should already be handling <code>SWTError</code> exceptions as
per the spec for the <code>DragSource</code> and <code>DropTarget</code>
constructors, this change should not impact existing clients. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=35214">35214</a>)</p>
<h3>Platform - Install/Update</h3>
<p>None.</p>
<h3>Platform - Ant</h3>
<p>None.</p>
<h3>Platform - Debug</h3>
<p>None.</p>
<h3>Platform - Search</h3>
<h4>Inexact matching</h4>
<p>There is a new preference setting that controls whether the search engine
should report inexact matches. The user can set this via the <b>Workbench &gt;
Search </b>preference page. The new API method <code>SearchUI.arePotentialMatchesIgnored</code>
should be used to query the preference setting. Existing clients that contribute
a particular search engine (or search page) should consider whether the notion
of an inexact match is meaningful in their particular context, and honor this
preference if it is. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20663">20663</a>)</p>
<h3>Platform - Text</h3>
<p>[TBD]</p>
<h3>Platform - Compare</h3>
<p>None.</p>
<h3>JDT - Core</h3>
<h4>Multiple output folders</h4>
<p>In Eclipse 2.0, all generated class files (and copied resource files) for a
Java project get written to the project's single output folder. As of 2.1, the
generated class files (and copied resource files) can be partitioned across
several output folders, with each source build path entry specifying which
output folder its generated files get written to. This change was made to give
certain kinds of users greater flexibility in laying out their Java projects on
disk. Clients used to be able to assume that a Java project's output files were
in the project's output folder (<code>IProject.getOutputLocation()</code>); now
they need to take into account the possibility of other output locations (<code>IClasspathEntry.getOutputLocation()
!= null</code>). Existing code appears to work fine until the user exercises the
additional flexibility. This change is most likely to affect client code that
deploys code directly from the project's output folder (e.g., creates a JAR;
launches a Java VM with the output folder on the runtime class path). (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=24123">24123</a>)</p>
<h4>Source folder exclusion patterns</h4>
<p>In Eclipse 2.0, all Java source files under a source folder on a project's
build class path were compiled and included in the Java model. The notion of
exclusion patterns were added in 2.1 to give certain kinds of users greater
flexibility in laying out their Java projects on disk&nbsp; Exclusion patterns
associated with a source entry on the build class path (<code>IClasspathEntry.getExclusionPatterns()</code>)
cause matching files or subdirectories to be ignored for the purposes of
compilation and inclusion in the Java model. Most existing clients traverse the
Java model and will continue to work fine. However, clients that directly
traverse the corresponding source folder in the local file system need to take
into account the possibility that some of the files found there may have been
excluded with this new mechanism. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=22039">22039</a>)</p>
<h4>Code formatter positions</h4>
<p>The specification for <code>ICodeFormatter.format</code> was changed to
specify that the positions array passed in must be in non-decreasing order. The
implementation had always been making this assumption, and there would have been
serious performance consequences to specify the method as working with unordered
positions. Existing clients are unlikely to be affected. (bug <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=30417">30417</a>)</p>
<h4>Leading comments on AST Statement nodes</h4>
<p><code>Statement.getLeadingComment</code> and <code>setLeadingComment</code>
have been deprecated because they were not a particularly good way to deal with
the general issue of comments and significant whitespace. Since the
implementations of <code>AST.parseCompilationUnit</code> never set the leading
comment for any AST nodes they create, the change is moot for most clients. (bug
<a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=29176">29176</a>)</p>
<h4>Empty array passed to Java model operation</h4>
<p>In Eclipse 2.0, certain Java model API operations (<code>IJavaModel.delete</code>,
<code>copy</code>, <code>move</code>, and <code>rename</code>) threw an <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>
if passed an empty array. The behavior in this case was completely unspecified.
For 2.1, the specification and implementation of these operations have been
changed to throw <code>JavaModelException</code> in such cases. Clients need to
be aware that the empty array case does indeed trigger an exception. (bug <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=32219">32219</a>)</p>
<h4>Non-Java projects included in Java model&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In Eclipse 2.0, non-Java projects and closed projects were excluded from the
Java model. In 2.1, non-Java projects and closed projects are available from the
Java model via <code>IJavaModel.getNonJavaResources</code>. Their inclusion in
the Java model means that they appear in Java model deltas, under <code>IJavaElementDelta.getResourceDeltas</code>.
This change may affect clients that listen for Java element deltas (via <code>JavaCore.addElementChangedListener</code>)
if they make overly strong assumptions about triggering conditions and contents.
(bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=29274">29274</a>)</p>
<h4>Java element changed events for full working copy lifecycle</h4>
<p>In Eclipse 2.0, Java element changed events were reported for changes to
shared working copies, but not when they were created or destroyed. In 2.1, Java
element changed events are uniformly issued for the full lifecycle of working
copies and apply equally to non-shared as well as shared working copies. This
change may affect clients that listen for Java element deltas (via <code>JavaCore.addElementChangedListener</code>)
if they make overly strong assumptions about triggering conditions and contents.
(bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=32981">32981</a>)</p>
<h4>IJavaProject.isOnClasspath</h4>
<p>For Eclipse 2.1, the API predicate <code>IJavaProject.isOnClasspath</code>
(both forms) was changed to do the more standard thing of returning false rather
than throwing <code>JavaModelException</code> in some cases. While this change
is within the original spirit of the original API&nbsp; contract, it breaks
source compatibility because <code>JavaModelException</code> is a checked
exception; code that invokes this method and catches <code>JavaModelException</code>
may need to be rewritten. (bug <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=33754">33754</a>)</p>

<h3>2.2 Incompatibilities between release 2.0 and 1.0</h3>
<p>(This section from the 2.0 release notes is included for the benefit of
customers migrating to 2.1 from 1.0.)</p>
The Eclipse SDK 2.0 is upwards compatible with the Eclipse SDK 1.0 to the
greatest extent possible. We made exceptions in areas where slavishly
maintaining compatibility would not be in the best interests of the Platform or
its clients. The exceptions noted in the 2.0 release notes are repeated here for
the benefit of customers migrating from 1.0 to 2.1 directly.
<h3>Platform - UI</h3>
<p>The public client API has been kept stable with the exception of <code>ITextViewer</code>
interface which changed in an incompatible way:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added method <code>ITextViewer.invalidateTextPresentation()</code></li>
  <li>Added method <code>ITextViewer.setDefaultPrefixes(String[] defaultPrefixes,
    String contentType)</code></li>
  <li>Removed method <code>ITextViewer.setDefaultPrefix(String defaultPrefix,
    String contentType)</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Platform - Debug</h3>
<p>The debug API has been completely reworked for 2.0. The new APIs are not
compatible with the 1.0 APIs, which were all considered &quot;interim&quot;.</p>
<p>The high level API differences between the new and old debug platforms are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Breakpoints - In 1.0, breakpoints were implemented as markers. In 2.0,
    breakpoints are implemented as objects (interface <code>IBreakpoint</code>),
    with an associated marker used for presentation in editors, and persistence
    of attributes. There is a new extension point for registering types of
    breakpoints: <code>org.eclipse.debug.core.breakpoints</code>.</li>
  <li>Launch Configurations - In 1.0, an <code>ILauncher</code> was used to
    launch applications. In 2.0, the concept of a &quot;launcher&quot; has been
    replaced with a launch configuration. There are new extension points to
    register launch configuration types, and for comparing launch configurations
    (<code>org.eclipse.debug.core.launchConfigurationTypes</code>, <code>org.eclipse.debug.core.launchConfigurationComparators</code>).
    The associated interfaces are <code>ILaunchConfigurationType</code>, <code>ILaunchConfiguration</code>,
    <code>ILaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy</code>, and <code>ILaunchConfigurationDelegate</code>.</li>
  <li>Launch Configuration Tab Groups - In 1.0, wizards were registered with
    launchers for launch related UI. In 2.0, the launch configuration dialog and
    launch shortcuts replace launch wizards. The associated extension points are
    <code>org.eclipse.debug.ui.launchConfigurationTabGroups</code>, <code>org.eclipse.debug.ui.launchConfigurationTypeImages</code>,
    and <code>org.eclipse.debug.ui.launchShortcuts</code>. The associated
    interfaces are <code>ILaunchConfigurationTabGroup</code>, <code>ILaunchConfigurationTab</code>,
    and <code>ILaunchShortcut</code>.</li>
  <li>Debug model API changes - Interfaces defining the debug model elements
    have been modified, and new debug elements have been added to support
    procedural debug and expression management.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well, the Java debug model API has been enhanced and changed to reflect
changes in the debug platform.</p>
<h3>Platform - Core</h3>
<p>Eclipse 1.0 Core Target Management was provisional. For 2.0, Core Target
Management has been withdrawn and replaced by team target management providers.
These new target management facilities are early access, and are contained in
the Eclipse FTP and WebDAV Support feature (separately installable).
<h3>Platform - Help</h3>
<p>Help APIs and extension points were marked as interim in Eclipse 1.0. Based
on the initial feedback, the Help APIs and extension points have changed
significantly in Eclipse 2.0 and are not compatible with those in Eclipse 1.0.</p>
<h3>Platform - Scripting</h3>
<p>Eclipse 1.0 Scripting support was provisional and incomplete. For 2.0, the
Scripting component has been withdrawn completely from the Eclipse Platform.
<h3>Platform - Install/Update</h3>
<p>The Install/Update component API has been completely reworked for 2.0. The
1.0 notion of component has been replaced in 2.0 by the notion of a feature. The
new APIs are not compatible with the 1.0 APIs, which were all considered
&quot;interim&quot;.</p>
<h3>Platform - Team</h3>
<p>Workspace compatibility from VCM CVS 1.0 to Team CVS 2.0: the meta
information for CVS providers has considerably changed from 1.0 to 2.0, and the
meta information is not being preserved. To ease migration, some automation of
migrating CVS repository locations is provided, and some helpful steps have been
included. These are described in the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-vcm-home/docs/online/cvs_features2.0/cvs-faq.html#10">Team
CVS FAQ</a>.</p>
<h3>PDE</h3>
<h4>Extension point schema file extension changed</h4>
<p>Extension point schema file extension has been changed from *.xsd to *.exsd
to avoid conflicts with XML schema editors and/or non-PDE schema files. PDE will
still detect files with the old extension and will issue a warning about the
change.</p>
<h4>Support for components removed</h4>
<p>Eclipse 2.0 Install/Update has discontinued the use of components in favor of
features. Consequently, PDE 2.0 supports feature-related development while
component support has been removed. Features are described in the Eclipse
Platform Plug-in Developer Guide.</p>

<h4>Eclipse process does not exit (HP-UX only)</h4>
<p>On HP-UX, the HP JVM process that runs the Eclipse Workbench does not
terminate upon closing the workbench. The remedy is to always pass the <code>-XdoCloseWithReadPending</code>
to the VM via the Eclipse launcher command line; that is, launch Eclipse with
the command line:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>eclipse -vmargs -XdoCloseWithReadPending</code></p>

<h4>DBCS support on Linux GTK (Linux GTK only)</h4>
<p>The versions of GTK included with RedHat Linux 8.0 and SuSE Linux 8.1 that we
tested support Latin-1 locales but not DCBS. The DCBS support in GTK 2.2 should
be sufficient, and in principle Eclipse should work on any recent Linux with GTK
2.2. We have verified that Eclipse DBCS support works with RedHat Linux 8.0 and
GTK 2.2. However, we were unable to get Eclipse working with SuSE Linux 8.1 and
and GTK 2.2, so this remains an open issue. (bug <font color="#FF0000">MISSING</font>)</p>
<h3>3.1.1 <a name="I-Platform - Core">Platform - Core</a></h3>
<h4>Declaring package name prefixes improves plug-in class loading speed</h4>
<p>A significant (10-15%) speed increase in the time to load a plug-in's classes
can be obtained simply by declaring the package name prefixes found in that
plug-in's runtime library JARs. This is done in the new Package Prefixes section
of the Runtime page in the PDE plug-in manifest editor. (Further information <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-core-home/docs/package-prefixes/prefixes.html">here</a>.)</p>
<h4><b>Invalid characters in install directory prevents Eclipse from starting</b></h4>
<p>Eclipse will fail to launch if installed in a directory whose path contains
certain invalid characters, including :%#&lt;&gt;&quot;!. The workaround is to
install Eclipse in a directory whose path does not contain invalid characters.
(bugs <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3109">3109</a> and <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17281">17281</a>)</p>
<h4><b>Problems with classloaders in created threads</b></h4>
<p>There is a known issue with trying to load classes from a newly created
thread using a class loader different from the plug-in class loader. The result
will be a <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>. As a workaround, do the
following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a thread in which to run your code.</li>
  <li>Send yourThread.setContextClassLoader(yourClassLoader); // you can find
    your classloader by grabbing a class it loaded (YourPluginClass.class.getClassLoader())</li>
  <li>Run your code in the newly created thread.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you set the context class loader for the current thread, you are competing
with other users of the thread (all of Eclipse), so the results will be
unpredictable. However, there should be no problem in practice provided you
reset the context class loader back to its original value when your use in the
current thread is&nbsp;<br>
complete. (bug <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8907">8907</a>)</p>
<h4>Deadlock creating executable extension in Plugin.startup</h4>
<p>If <code>Plugin.startup</code> code is too complex and performs tasks such as
creating an executable extension, a deadlock situation can be created. Only
simple bookkeeping tasks should be performed in <code>Plugin.startup</code>
code. (bugs <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=12827">12827</a>,

<h3>3.1.7 <a name="I-Platform - Team - CVS">Platform - Team - CVS</a></h3>
<p>The following are known problems with the CVS repository provider only, and
do not apply to other repository providers. Additional information on how to use
CVS from Eclipse can be found in the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-vcm-home/docs/online/cvs_features2.0/cvs-faq.html">Eclipse
CVS FAQ</a>.</p>
<p><b>Cached authorization information lost when workspace is upgraded</b></p>
<p>The Platform's internal authorization database file format has changed for
2.1. Because of this, authorization information cached with a workspace created
with an earlier version of Eclipse will be unusable, and the user will need to
reauthenticate. (bug <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=32899">32899</a>)</p>
<h4>&quot;extssh&quot; is not a supported command line method</h4>
<p>Since the &quot;extssh&quot; connection method is not a supported command
line method, you cannot use the command line tool when a project uses this

appropriate environment variables so that the command line tool will work. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=7943">7943</a>)</p>
<h4>Connection cannot be found after initially missing</h4>
<p>If a connection initially fails due to a network problem, the connection may

the connection you must exit and restart Eclipse. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=9295">9295</a>)</p>
<h4>CVS meta-folders appear in some cases</h4>
<p>There are some cases where CVS folders are not hidden from the UI as the user
would expect. For instance, CVS folders will appear if a user imports a CVS
project into Eclipse before the CVS plug-in is loaded. To avoid this, open the
CVS Repositories view (thus loading the CVS plug-in) before importing CVS
projects into Eclipse. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=21128">21128</a>)</p>
<h4>&quot;Received broken pipe signal&quot; error from server</h4>
<p>Eclipse sometime performs multiple commands within a single connection to the

<h4>Error updating incoming directory additions with pruning turned off</h4>
<p>If pruning is turned off and a project has incoming nested folder additions

<h4><font color="#00FF00">Missing debug attributes</font></h4>
<font color="#00FF00">The debugger requires that class files be compiled with
debug attributes if it is to be able to display line numbers and local
variables. Quite often, class libraries (for example, &quot;<code>rt.jar</code>&quot;)
are compiled without complete debug attributes, and thus local variables and
method arguments for those classes are not visible in the debugger.</font>
<h4><font color="#00FF00">Setting breakpoints</font></h4>
<font color="#00FF00">In general the debugger will not allow you to place
breakpoints on lines of code that are not executable (comments, blank lines,
etc.). However, there are some cases where the debugger will allow breakpoints
on lines of code that are not executable. For example, the debugger will allow a
breakpoint to be placed on a variable declaration that does not contain an
initializer (&quot;int x;&quot;). Note that enabled breakpoints which are
successfully installed on an executable line in a running (debuggable) VM are
displayed with a checkmark. Breakpoints that are displayed without a checkmark
are not installed in a running (debuggable) VM.</font>
<h4><font color="#00FF00">Using Hot Code Replace</font></h4>
<font color="#00FF00">Hot code replace is supported on JDK 1.4.x VMs, and IBM J9
VMs. Hot code replace is limited to changes which do not effect the shape of a
class. That is, changes within existing methods are supported, but the addition
or removal of members is not supported.</font>

<h4><font color="#00FF00">Debugging over slow connections</font></h4>
<font color="#00FF00">A global Java debug preference specifies the debugger
timeout, which is the maximum amount of time the debugger waits for a response
from the target VM after making a request of that VM. Slow connections may
require that this value be increased. The timeout value can be edited from the <b>Java
&gt; Debug </b>preference page. Changing the timeout value only effects
subsequently launched VM, not VMs that are already running.</font>
<h4><font color="#00FF00">Updating of inspected values</font></h4>
<font color="#00FF00">When inspecting the result of an evaluated expression in
the debugger, it is important to note that the result displayed is the result of
that expression at the time it was evaluated. For example, when inspecting a
simple integer counter (primitive data type), the value displayed in the
Expressions view is the value when the expression was evaluated. As the counter
is changed in the running program, the inspected result will not change (since
the view is not displaying the value bound to a variable - it is displaying the
value of an expression, and the value of a primitive data type cannot change).
However, if an expression results in an object, fields of that object will be
updated in the inspector as they change in the running program (since the value
bound to fields in an object can change).</font>
<h4><font color="#00FF00">Stepping over native methods that perform I/O</font></h4>
<font color="#00FF00">When the debugger steps over native methods that perform
I/O to <code>System.out</code> or <code>System.err</code>, the output may not
appear immediately unless the native performs a flush on the output buffer.</font>
<h4><font color="#00FF00">VM and process termination running on IBM 1.3 JVM on

Environment (PDE)</a></h3>
<h4>PDE source page colors do not take effect on Apply</h4>
<p>Changes to the colors PDE uses for source pages of its multi-page editors are
not immediately visible in opened editors after pressing the Apply button
on&nbsp; the <b>Plug-in Development &gt; Editors preference</b> page. To work
around this problem, close the editor and and reopen it. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=33640">33640</a>)</p>
<h4>Icons folder not included in bin.includes of some PDE templates</h4>
<p>PDE provides a number of templates that can be used to create fully
functioning plug-in projects and/or extensions. When projects are created, the <code>build.properties</code>
file is created with the initial content, which includes the property 'bin.includes'
listing the plug-in manifest and its code JARs. However, it omits mention of
other files created by the template, such as the <code>icons/</code> folder. As
a request, these extra files do not end up in the plug-in when built using Ant
build file or exported using 'Export deployable plug-ins and fragments' wizard.
To work around this problem, add these files and directories manually in
build.properties file. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=35554">35554</a>)</p>

</font>
<h4>Comments in source pages of PDE XML editors</h4>
<p>PDE provides a number of multi-page editors that include a raw source page.
Editors that handle XML files (plug-in, fragment and feature manifests) will
preserve comments in most cases. However, comments will not be preserved if
added before the root XML element, or if added after the last child element
contained in the parent element. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8000">8000</a>)</p>
<h4>Problem while importing fragments</h4>
<p>If a workspace contains binary projects for a plug-in and a fragment that
references that plug-in, fragment libraries are added to the class path of the
referenced plug-in project. When an attempt is made to overwrite the plug-in and
the fragment with versions from another build, deletion of the old fragment may
fail. If that happens, repeat the operation to repair the workspace. Only the
affected plug-in and fragment need to be re-imported. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=16921">16921</a>)</p>
<h4>Plug-in import wizard does not allow plug-ins of different versions to be
imported</h4>
<p>The Eclipse platform allows two plug-ins with the same ID but different
versions to coexist if the only thing they contribute is run-time libraries.
However, PDE cannot handle these plug-ins because it creates project names using
plug-in IDs during binary project import. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=18500">18500</a>)</p>
<h4>PDE nature required for plug-in manifest syntax checking</h4>
<p>PDE will only be able to provide syntax checking and error/warning markers
for plug-in manifests if the plug-in project has the PDE plug-in nature. A
plug-in project automatically gets this nature when created by a PDE wizard.
This situation can only occur if a regular Java project has been used to host a
plug-in. The problem can be fixed by converting it into a PDE project. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19248">19248</a>)</p>
<h4>PDE does not preserve original manifest file layout</h4>
<p>When non-Source page of a PDE manifest editor is used, PDE will convert
changes back into XML by regenerating the file. Although the overall content and
the comments are preserved, the actual file layout is not. This may cause
problems by showing false changes during file compare. If file layout is
important, perform all editing in the Source page. Alternatively, avoid using
Source pages altogether. Since XML files are generated in a way that respects
and preserves the relative order of major elements (extensions, extension points
etc.), changes made in a non-Source page of a PDE manifest editor do not result
in false deltas during file compare. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=19251">19251</a>)</p>
<h4>Go To Line in manifest editor causes Outline view to go blank</h4>
<p>When the <b>Source &gt; Go To Line</b> command is invoked in the Source page
of a PDE manifest editor, the Outline view will become gray. Since the Source
page does not have a functional outline, there is no actual loss of function.

<h4>When mapped to a target, the project folder is ignored</h4>
<p>Ignoring the project folder is by design. Normally with target management you
put/get the contents of the project, not the actual project. The place you pick
in the site explorer is where the project contents will go. This allows your
local project to have a different name than the container in the WebDAV/FTP
server. If you want to map several projects to the same site location, you
create a new folder for each one. This is why &quot;New Folder&quot; is in the
mapping page. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17657">17657</a>)</p>
<h4>FTP messages cause an exception</h4>
<p>With some servers, the FTP client may receive messages that it did not

works. (bug <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=18108">18108</a>)</p>

<h2>5. <a name="Interoperability with Previous Releases">Interoperability with
Previous Releases</a></h2>
<h3>Interoperability of Release 2.1 and 2.0</h3>
<h4>Sharing projects between heterogeneous Eclipse 2.0 and 2.1</h4>
<p>Special care is required when a project in a team repository is being loaded
and operated on by developers using Eclipse-based products based on different
feature or plug-in versions. The general problem is that the existence,
contents, and interpretation of metadata files in the workspaces may be specific
to a particular feature or plug-in version, and differ between versions. The
workspace compatibility guarantees only cover cases where all developers upgrade
their Eclipse workspaces in lock step. In those cases there should be no problem
with shared metadata. However, when some developers are working in Eclipse 2.1
while others are working in Eclipse 2.0, there are no such guarantees. This
section provides advice for what to do and to not do. It addresses the specific
issues with the Eclipse SDK.</p>
<p>The typical failure mode is noticed by the 2.1 user. 2.1 metadata is lost
when a 2.0 user saves changes and then commits the updated metadata files to the
repository. Here's how things typically go awry:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A user working in Eclipse 2.1 creates or modifies a project in a way that
    results in changes to a shared metadata file that rely on 2.1-specific
    information. The user then commits the updated project files, including the
    shared metadata file, to the shared repository.</li>
  <li>Another user working in Eclipse 2.0 shares this project from the same
    repository. The 2.1-specific information in the shared metadata file is not
    understood by Eclipse 2.0, and is generally discarded or ignored without
    warning. The user modifies the project in a way that results in changes to
    the shared metadata file, causing the shared metadata file to be rewritten
    without any of the 2.1-specific information. The user commits the updated
    project files, including the shared metadata file, to the shared repository.
    The user is generally unaware that shared information has just been lost as
    a result of their actions.</li>
  <li>A user working in Eclipse 2.1 picks up the changes to a project from the
    shared repository, including the updated shared metadata file. The user may
    be unaware that they have just taken a retrograde step until later, when
    things start to malfunction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a list of things to watch out for when the project is to be shared
with 2.0:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Linked folders and files<br>
    </b>This support was added in 2.1. Information about linked resources is
    recorded in the project's <code>.project</code> file. Recommendation: do not
    use. Better still, disable linked resources via the <b>Workbench &gt; Linked
    Resources</b> preference page.</li>
  <li><b>External tool (Ant) builders</b><br>
    Information about external tool builder is recorded in the project's <code>.project</code>
    file. The format of the information changed between 2.0 and 2.1. Builders
    created or changed in 2.1 use the new format, which is not understood by a
    2.0 workspace. Builders created in 2.0 use the old format and continue to
    work in 2.1. Recommendation: Always create or edit external tools builders
    from a 2.0 workspace.</li>
  <li><b>Optional exclusion patterns on Java source entries on the build class
    path</b><br>
    This support was added in 2.1. This information is recorded in the project's
    <code>.classpath</code> file. Recommendation: do not specify exclusion
    patterns.&nbsp; Better still, disable exclusion patterns via the<b> Java
    &gt; Compiler &gt; Build Path</b>&nbsp; preference page.</li>
  <li><b>Output folders associated with Java source entries on the build class
    path</b><br>
    This support was added in 2.1. This information is recorded in the project's
    <code>.classpath</code> file. Recommendation: do not specify anything other
    than the default (project-wide) output folder.&nbsp; Better still, disable
    multiple output locations via the<b> Java &gt; Compiler &gt; Build Path</b>&nbsp;
    preference page.</li>
  <li><b>Source attachment root path associated with Java library entries on the
    build class path</b><br>
    When attaching a source ZIP to a library JAR on the Java build path, the
    source root path prefix is inferred automatically. This has changed from
    2.0, where it could be explicitly set via the UI and explicitly recorded in
    the project's <code>.classpath</code> file. Consequently, a Java project
    created in a 2.1 workspace might not find the attached source.
    Recommendation: Use 2.0 to specify the source attachment root path. There is
    additional source attachment flexibility provided in 2.1: you can provide a
    folder instead of a JAR or zip as a source attachment, and you can attach
    source to a class file folder; this functionality is not available in 2.0
    (where the 2.1 information is ignored).&nbsp; Recommendation: Use 2.0 to
    specify the source attachment.</li>
  <li><b>PDE classpath containers for dependent plug-ins</b><br>
    PDE's use of classpath containers was added in 2.1. Classpath containers are
    recorded in the project's <code>.classpath</code> file. If PDE classpath
    containers are used, then a 2.0 workspace will have unresolved classpath
    entries and therefore most Java capabilities (including compilation, search,
    run, debug) will not produce the expected results. Recommendation: Ensure
    that the setting on the <b>Plug-in Development &gt; Java Build Path Control </b>preference
    page for using classpath containers is disabled before creating any plug-in
    (or fragment) projects.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Using Eclipse 2.1 to develop plug-ins that work in Eclipse 2.0</h4>
<p>It is also possible (and reasonable) to use Eclipse 2.1 to develop a plug-in
intended to work in Eclipse 2.0. Use the <b>Plug-in Development &gt; Target
Platform </b>preference page to locate non-workspace plug-ins in an 2.0 Eclipse
install. This ensures that the code for your plug-in is being compiled and
tested against Eclipse 2.0 APIs, extension points, and plug-ins. (The above list
of concerns do not apply since they affect the layout and interpretation of
files in the plug-in <i>project</i> but none affect the actual deployed form of
the plug-in.)</p>
